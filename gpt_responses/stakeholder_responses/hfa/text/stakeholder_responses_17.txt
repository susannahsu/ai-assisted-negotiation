Based on the detailed account of the situation involving Health for All (HfA) in Iguwafe, Country Beta, a comprehensive stakeholder mapping visualization is essential to navigate the ongoing negotiation effectively. The protagonist in this scenario is HfA, while the counterparties are the local tribal leaders strongly opposing HfA's decision to relocate resources to Ukraine, manifested through the detainment of HfA staff. Here's a structured approach to creating a stakeholder map for this context:

1. **HfA (Protagonist)**: Positioned to represent their inclination towards serving conflict zones and reassigning resources to Ukraine, indicating a transformative objective yet with a high global influence.
2. **Tribal Leaders (Counterparty)**: Central to the negotiation, directly opposing HfA's actions and decisions, thus positioned at the origin.
3. **Local Hospital Staff and Community**: Highly dependent on HfA's presence and services, reflecting a more conservative view wanting to maintain the status quo but with significant local influence.
4. **Government of Beta**: Exhibits a conservative approach to intervention, indicating a preference to avoid escalation, with moderate influence.
5. **International Donors (Germany and Switzerland)**: Having a transformative view by steering HfA's focus to Ukraine, reflective of a strategic global influence.
6. **UN and Other NGOs**: Holding varying degrees of influence and perspectives on the negotiation, from advocating for HfA's continued presence to navigating security concerns.

Below is the standardized `matplotlib` script adapted to this scenario:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map for HfA Negotiation in Iguwafe')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party (Tribal Leaders)
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Tribal Leaders')  # 'ro' for red circle

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Plotting stakeholders
stakeholders = {
    'HfA': (-7, 7),  # Assuming HfA favors transformative change with global influence
    'Local Hospital and Community': (5, -7),  # Conservative, high local influence
    'Government of Beta': (4, -3),  # Slightly conservative, moderate influence
    'International Donors': (-6, 6),  # Transformative, high global influence
    'UN/NGOs': (-3, 3)  # Variable positions based on specific organization's stance
}

# Plot each stakeholder
for label, (x, y) in stakeholders.items():
    ax.plot(x, y, 'bo')  # 'bo' for blue circles
    ax.annotate(label, (x, y), textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Show the plot
output_file_path = os.path.join('gpt_responses/plots', 'HfA_Iguwafe_Negotiation.png')
plt.savefig(output_file_path)
```

This script generates a stakeholder map that visually represents the negotiation landscape for HfA in Iguwafe, detailing the positions and influence of key stakeholders involved in the situation.
