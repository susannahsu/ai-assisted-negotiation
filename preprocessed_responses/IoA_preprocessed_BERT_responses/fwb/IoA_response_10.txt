 recommendations for negotiation

 prioritize:
[NUMBER]. establishing a clear, transparent mechanism for aid distribution that ensures aid reaches the intended beneficiaries without diversion.
[NUMBER]. seeking common ground on alternative methods for involving the local community in the distribution process that do not compromise fwb's principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.
[NUMBER]. implementing a third-party monitoring system to oversee the distribution process and ensure compliance with agreed terms.
[NUMBER]. leveraging support from international bodies or neutral stakeholders to act as mediators if necessary.
[NUMBER]. establishing a direct channel of communication with refugee leaders to accurately assess needs and ensure that their voices are heard in planning and execution phases.

 avoid:
[NUMBER]. employment of guards with potential affiliations to armed militias, ensuring adherence to fwb's principles and mitigating risks of aid diversion.
[NUMBER]. making concessions that would enable camp authorities to exert control over aid distribution beyond security concerns.
[NUMBER]. agreeing to compensation in forms that could potentially enable the diversion of aid from its intended beneficiaries.
[NUMBER]. rushing the verification process related to the nutritional assessment and the comprehensive identification of beneficiaries, to ensure aid effectiveness.
[NUMBER]. ignoring the broader political context and potential implications of decisions on fwb's operational capacity and reputation.
