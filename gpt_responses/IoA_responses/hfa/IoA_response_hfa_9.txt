Based on the comprehensive situation narrated, the mission of Health for All (HfA) in the Iguwafe region of Country Beta, here is how the Island of Agreement (IoA) table for the negotiation with tribal leaders and other stakeholders can be populated:

### Contested Facts:
- The adequacy of HfA's consultations with local stakeholders before deciding to redirect resources to Ukraine.
- The perception of HfA staff as hostages vs. guests under house arrest by tribesmen.
- The ability of local health authorities and NGOs to fill the healthcare void left by HfA’s potential departure.
- The extent to which local guards’ families are entitled to benefits from HfA.

### Agreed Facts:
- HfA's critical role in providing surgical and healthcare services in a region with limited healthcare infrastructure.
- The escalating health crisis due to measles outbreaks and the lack of vaccinations.
- The significant contribution of local guards in maintaining the security and operation of the hospital during the conflict.
- The necessity for HfA to strategize for the safe release of its staff detained by tribesmen.

### Convergent Norms:
- The shared value of ensuring the health and wellbeing of the Iguwafe community.
- Recognition of the sacrifices made by local guards and their families during the conflict.
- The need for continuous dialogue and negotiation to resolve the current standoff.
- Agreement on the principle that healthcare provision should not be abruptly halted without ensuring a transition or alternative.

### Divergent Norms:
- Views on the future roles of international NGOs like HfA in the region, especially with differing priorities of global donors.
- The method and extent of compensation for families of the local guards and the community's role in HfA operations.
- Perspectives on HfA’s decision-making autonomy vs. local stakeholders’ consultation requirements and consent.

### Recommendations:

#### Prioritize:
- Establishing a clear dialogue with tribal leaders focusing on immediate healthcare needs, like the measles outbreak and urgent surgeries, to build trust and demonstrate goodwill.
- Offering a detailed transition plan that includes training local health staff, possibly with a phased handover to local authorities or another NGO, while securing the release of the detained staff.
- Negotiating terms for compensations or support for local guards' families directly affected by the conflict, potentially as part of HfA’s exit strategy from Iguwafe.
- Exploring external funding specifically earmarked for responding to the measles outbreak and immediate healthcare needs as a gesture of goodwill and commitment to the community's health.

#### Avoid:
- Ignoring or downplaying the local perceptions and grievances regarding HfA’s operational decisions and their impacts on the community.
- Making public or aggressive demands that may be perceived as disrespectful to the cultural or authoritative stature of the tribal leaders.
- Over-promising on HfA’s capacity to continue operations or make immediate changes without consulting the main donors or the headquarters in Geneva.
- Underestimating the seriousness of the security situation for the detained staff and the potential for escalation if negotiations falter.
