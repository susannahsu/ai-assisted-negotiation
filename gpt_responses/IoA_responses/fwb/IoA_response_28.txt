Based on the comprehensive information provided, here is the Island of Agreement (IoA) table for the case involving Food Without Borders (FWB) and the camp authorities:

**Contested Facts:**
- The necessity of involving local guards in the food distribution process.
- The appropriateness of compensating guards with food rations.
- The accuracy and sufficiency of existing data on the population's nutritional status as claimed by the Camp Commander.
- The reliability and intentions of the local guards and militia, as perceived by various stakeholders.
- The legality and recognition of the refugee status.

**Agreed Facts:**
- Over 160,000 displaced individuals are residing in the primary camp, facing severe nutrition deficiencies and inadequate living conditions.
- A continuous influx of refugees into the camps is reported.
- Both parties acknowledge the urgent need for food assistance within the camp.
- FWB's commitment to providing aid impartially and neutrally.

**Convergent Norms:**
- The recognition of the dire humanitarian situation and the urgent need for food assistance.
- Acknowledgment of the value of security within the camp to a certain extent for the safety of both the refugees and aid workers.
- Both parties' expressed intent to assist the refugee population efficiently and effectively.

**Divergent Norms:**
- FWB's policy against employing or compensating guards, especially with food rations, due to concerns of diversion and maintaining neutrality.
- The camp authorities' insistence on the use of local guards for security during food distribution and their compensation with food rations.
- Differing views on the definition, rights, and treatment of refugees between FWB, Alpha government, and militia.

**Recommendations:**

**Prioritize:**
- Establishing a mutual understanding with the camp authorities regarding the critical need for a comprehensive and unbiased nutritional assessment before food distribution.
- Exploring alternative compensation methods for guards that do not involve direct in-kind food payment but adhere to FWB's principles and objectives.
- Negotiating for the allowance of FWB to vet and select a diverse workforce for food distribution to include individuals unrelated to the local militia or guards, potentially from surrounding communities or vetted refugees within the camp.
- Seeking third-party mediation or support from international entities or the local government to reinforce FWB's position on maintaining neutrality and impartiality, while ensuring effective aid distribution.

**Avoid:**
- Any agreements leading to the diversion of food aid from its intended beneficiaries, thus compromising the mission to assist the most vulnerable populations.
- Direct confrontation or contentious discourse that might jeopardize FWB's ability to operate in the camp or lead to withdrawal of cooperation from the camp authorities.
- Overlooking local dynamics and political sensitivities, which could potentially escalate tensions or contribute to the insecurity within the camp.

Through careful navigation of the contested and agreed facts, and by emphasizing convergent norms while diplomatically addressing divergent norms, FWB can work towards establishing a constructive negotiation framework with the camp authorities.
