Given the complex situation surrounding Health for All (HfA) in Iguwafe, Country Beta, a detailed stakeholder map is imperative to navigate the negotiation and ensure a strategic approach for the safe release of HfA staff and the continuation of healthcare services in the region. Below is the Python script using `matplotlib` to plot the stakeholders based on their inclination toward change (transformative to conservative) and their influence (local to global).

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party (Tribal Leaders at the origin, identified as the main counterparty)
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Tribal Leaders')  # 'ro' for red circle

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Other stakeholders
# Health for All (HfA)
x_HfA = 5
y_HfA = 7
ax.plot(x_HfA, y_HfA, 'go', label='HfA')  # 'go' for green circle

# Government of Beta
x_gov = -4
y_gov = 3
ax.plot(x_gov, y_gov, 'bo', label='Gov of Beta')  # 'bo' for blue circle

# UN Humanitarian Coordinator
x_UN = -2
y_UN = 8
ax.plot(x_UN, y_UN, 'bo', label='UN Coordinator')  # 'bo' for blue circle

# German and Swiss Donors
x_donors = 7
y_donors = 5
ax.plot(x_donors, y_donors, 'bo', label='Donors (Germany & Switzerland)')  # 'bo' for blue circle

# Local Guards & Families
x_guards = -1
y_guards = -3
ax.plot(x_guards, y_guards, 'bo', label='Local Guards & Families')  # 'bo' for blue circle

# Local Hospital & Patients
x_hospital = -5
y_hospital = -2
ax.plot(x_hospital, y_hospital, 'bo', label='Local Hospital & Patients')  # 'bo' for blue circle

# International Community & Other NGOs
x_intl = 2
y_intl = 9
ax.plot(x_intl, y_intl, 'bo', label='International NGOs')  # 'bo' for blue circle

# Adding labels to the points
labels = ['Tribal Leaders', 'HfA', 'Gov of Beta', 'UN Coordinator', 'Donors (Germany & Switzerland)', 'Local Guards & Families', 'Local Hospital & Patients', 'International NGOs']
coordinates = [(0, 0), (x_HfA, y_HfA), (x_gov, y_gov), (x_UN, y_UN), (x_donors, y_donors), (x_guards, y_guards), (x_hospital, y_hospital), (x_intl, y_intl)]

for i, txt in enumerate(labels):
    ax.annotate(txt, coordinates[i], textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Show the plot
output_file_path = os.path.join('gpt_responses/plots', f'plot{0}.png')
plt.savefig(output_file_path)
```

This script outlines the initial positioning of stakeholders based on the extensive background provided. It includes the protagonist (Health for All, HfA), marked in green, at a position indicating their inclination towards transformative objectives but recognizing their global influence and constraints. The counterparty (Tribal Leaders), is at the origin, marked in red, signifying their central role in opposition to HfA's objectives. Other stakeholders such as the Government of Beta, UN Humanitarian Coordinator, German and Swiss donors, local guards and families, local hospital and patients, and international NGOs are plotted according to their objectives and influence in this negotiation context.

This map serves as a starting point. Adjustments can be made based on user feedback and additional insights to better reflect the dynamics and potential negotiation paths.
