 recommendations

 prioritize:
- establishing a clear, shared understanding of the immediate healthcare needs in iguwafe and how they can be addressed, including measles outbreaks and surgeries.
- building trust and a respectful dialogue with tribal leaders, emphasizing shared values around community health and safety.
- developing a transparent, phased plan for transitioning hfa's operations that includes input from local stakeholders to ensure continuity of care.
- exploring partnerships with other ngos (e.g., cpi, fwb) and local authorities to sustain essential health services, including vaccination campaigns and basic surgical care.

 avoid:
- public or private statements that might inflame tensions or create further misunderstandings about hfa's intentions and capabilities.
- overlooking or minimizing the importance of compensating and supporting the families of local guards who have been affected by violence, as this is a potent symbol of hfa's commitment to the community.
- making any commitments or promises that hfa cannot realistically fulfill, given funding constraints and other organizational priorities.
- underestimating the complexity of local politics and the influence of tribal leaders; ensuring all negotiations are conducted with sensitivity to local norms and respect for all involved.
