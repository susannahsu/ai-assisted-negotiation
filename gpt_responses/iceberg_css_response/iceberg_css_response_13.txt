#### 2. Compensation in Form of Food Rations

- **Reasoning**: Cash payments are deemed less useful in a region where food prices are exorbitant. Food rations are seen as a more viable form of compensation.

##### User’s Organization: FWB

#### 3. Conducting a Nutritional Assessment

##### Counterparty: Camp Authorities

- **Reasoning**: They wish to expedite aid distribution to alleviate immediate needs and possibly to maintain control over the distribution.
- **Motives and Values**: Balancing the urgent need for food assistance in the camp and asserting authority and control over the humanitarian processes within their jurisdiction.

##### User’s Organization: FWB

- **Motives and Values**: Responsibility to ensure that the provided aid meets the actual needs of the population based on accurate and current data.
- **Reasoning**: A comprehensive nutritional assessment is required to tailor the aid distribution to the needs of the refugees, ensuring effective and equitable assistance.
- **Positions**: Insists on conducting its own nutritional assessment to inform the food distribution strategy according to the needs of the population and the requirements of its donors, such as the German government.

This structured approach outlines the areas of contention between the camp authorities and FWB, with specific focus on the principles and values driving both organizations. The aim is to establish a grounded understanding that could serve as a basis for resolving these critical negotiation aspects, ensuring aid delivery to the refugee population in an efficient, impartial, and transparent manner.
