**Island of Agreement (IoA) Table:**

- **Contested Facts:**
  1. HfA's abrupt decision to close Iguwafe operations without local consultation.
  2. Perceived immediate and irreversible character of closing surgery operations at Iguwafe.
  3. Alleged increase in measles cases and HfA's role in addressing it.
  4. Compensation claims by families of guards who were harmed or killed.
  5. Operational shift of HfA from Beta to Ukraine.
  6. Demands for continuing specific health operations by the tribesmen and local community.

- **Agreed Facts:**
  1. HfA's significant role in providing surgical care and its impact on the local health infrastructure.
  2. The socioeconomic and health challenges faced by the local population.
  3. The critical security role played by local guards in ensuring HfA's operational capacity.
  4. The high burden of infectious diseases, including measles, in the region.
  5. The need for HfA's international staff's safe release.
  6. The absence of other healthcare providers in the area due to various constraints.

- **Convergent Norms:**
  1. The right of the local population to access essential healthcare services.
  2. The obligation of HfA to consider the well-being and safety of its staff and the local population it serves.
  3. Recognition of the role of tribal leaders in mediating and securing agreements.
  4. Acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by local guards during conflicts.

- **Divergent Norms:**
  1. Perceptions of HfA's responsibility towards the local health sector after its mission scope changes.
  2. The appropriate level of compensation or benefits for families of guards affected by the conflict.
  3. The validity and necessity of HfA's shift in focus to Ukraine due to donor preferences and areas of immediate need.
  4. The extent to which local tribal authorities can dictate the operations and decisions of international NGOs.

**Negotiation Strategies Recommendations:**

- **Prioritize:**
  1. Ensuring the safety and well-being of detained HfA staff as a non-negotiable point.
  2. Establishing a dialogue focusing on restarting essential health operations immediately, specifically addressing measles outbreaks and urgent surgeries.
  3. Seeking common ground on HfA's capacity to support local health needs, perhaps through a phased approach or transition plan, with a definitive timeline.
  4. Offering technical support and training to local healthcare providers as a sustainable compromise.
  5. Discussing the nature and scope of benefits or support for the families of guards in a respectful and culturally sensitive manner.
  6. Leveraging the support of other NGOs (like FWB) and international bodies (like the UN) familiar with the local dynamics to facilitate negotiations.

- **Avoid:**
  1. Dismissing local perceptions of HfA's abrupt departure and its impact on the community's health and safety.
  2. Over-committing to actions that HfA cannot sustain due to financial or operational constraints.
  3. Antagonizing tribal leaders or local authorities by disregarding their concerns or navigating around them.
  4. Publicly framing the situation as a hostage crisis, which may escalate tensions and complicate negotiations.
  5. Ignoring the role of local media and public opinion in shaping the narrative and pressure points.
  6. Underestimating the complexity of local socio-political dynamics and the significance of tribal leaders' endorsement for a peaceful resolution.
