island of agreement table:

contested facts:
- effectiveness of the camp's current data on the population's nutritional status.
- necessity and scope of fwb's proposed nutritional assessment.
- the true intentions and activities of refugees trading food rations.
- the impact of employing local guards on the neutrality and impartiality of fwb.

agreed facts:
- over [NUMBER],[NUMBER] refugees are housed in the primary camp, with children and women comprising a majority and facing severe nutritional deficiencies.
- refugees are confined to the camps and require permission to leave, exposing them to control and exploitation by local guards.
- fwb has committed to providing emergency food aid to the refugees.
- all parties acknowledge the critical need for food aid among the refugee population.

convergent norms:
- the immediate and uninterrupted provision of food aid is crucial for the well-being and survival of the refugees.
- maintaining the dignity, safety, and health of the refugee population is a priority.
- efforts should be made to ensure aid reaches its intended beneficiaries without diversion.

divergent norms:
- fwb insists on neutrality, impartiality, and independence in its operations, refraining from employing local militia members as guards.
- camp authorities demand local guards be compensated with food rations for their services, citing their families' food insecurity.
- the camp authorities and local militia view the employment and compensation of guards differently than fwb, considering them and their families as deserving beneficiaries.

recommendations:

prioritize:
- engaging an independent third party to conduct the nutritional assessment to ensure transparency and acceptance by all parties.
- exploring alternative mechanisms for distributing food aid that maintain fwb’s principles while addressing security concerns, possibly through technology or third-party monitoring.
- working with international and local stakeholders to establish a monitored corridor or safe zones that allow fwb to operate independently within the camp.
- advocating for additional resources and support from the international community to address the broader humanitarian needs, beyond food, like health, sanitation, and potential relocation or resettlement pathways for refugees.

avoid:
- direct employment or compensation of local militia members as it violates fwb's principles and risks further entrenching power dynamics that exploit refugees.
- overlooking the importance of a comprehensive and transparent assessment of the refugees' nutritional needs, as it could lead to inefficient aid distribution.
- underestimating the potential leverage and influence that international and governmental stakeholders might exert over the camp authorities and local militia.
- ignoring the long-term implications of decisions made regarding employment and compensation structures within the camp on the community and fwb’s operational integrity.
