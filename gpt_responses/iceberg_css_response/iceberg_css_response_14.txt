### Negotiation Aspects Between FWB and Camp Authorities

**1. Requirement for FWB to Hire Local Guards for Food Distribution**

- **Counterparty (Camp Authorities):**
  - *Positions*: Insist that FWB hires local guards for food distribution.
  - *Reasoning*: Believe guards are essential for maintaining order and security during distribution. Additionally, view this as an opportunity to provide financial or in-kind support to the guards and their families.
  - *Motives and Values*: Aim to sustain local militia members and their families through employment and compensation; enhance control over camp operations and resources.

- **User's Organization (FWB):**
  - *Motives and Values*: Committed to neutrality, impartiality, and ensuring aid reaches those in need without diversion. Aims to provide aid responsibly without contributing to potential conflicts of interest or exploitation.
  - *Reasoning*: Believes hiring local guards tied to militias contravenes its principles and risks aid diversion. Prefers to independently vet and hire staff to maintain impartiality and ensure aid distribution efficiency.
  - *Positions*: Rejects the demand to hire local guards for food distribution due to concerns about neutrality and the potential for aid diversion.

**2. Compensation in Food Rations for Guards**

- **Counterparty (Camp Authorities):**
  - *Positions*: Demand that local guards receive food rations as compensation.
  - *Reasoning*: Argue that due to high food prices and limited utility of cash in the region, food rations are a more practical form of compensation.
  - *Motives and Values*: Seeks to provide sustenance for guardsâ€™ families facing food insecurity; maintain a semblance of economic stability within the camp communities.

- **User's Organization (FWB):**
  - *Motives and Values*: Aims to ensure that aid reaches its intended recipients without being subject to unethical diversion or resale.
  - *Reasoning*: Concerned that distributing food rations as compensation could lead to the reallocation of aid away from needy refugees and towards the market, contravening donor agreements and organizational principles.
  - *Positions*: Opposes the idea of compensating guards in food rations to prevent potential diversion of aid.

**3. Autonomy in Conducting Nutritional Assessments and Staff Hiring**

- **Counterparty (Camp Authorities):**
  - *Positions*: Oppose FWB conducting its own nutritional assessments and hiring non-guard labor.
  - *Reasoning*: Prefer to use existing data and maintain control over who operates within the camp, likely to ensure continued influence and oversight.
  - *Motives and Values*: Desire to uphold authority within the camp and possibly prevent uncovering of misallocated aid resources; maintain economic and social structure benefiting the militia.

- **User's Organization (FWB):**
  - *Motives and Values*: Committed to accurately identifying and assisting the most vulnerable based on impartial and accurate assessments; dedicated to maintaining operational independence and adherence to humanitarian principles.
  - *Reasoning*: A comprehensive nutritional assessment ensures aid is appropriately targeted, and independent hiring practices ensure staff integrity and impartiality.
  - *Positions*: Insists on conducting its own nutritional assessments and vetting of potential workers to ensure efficiency and fairness in aid distribution, opposing the camp authorities' demands.
