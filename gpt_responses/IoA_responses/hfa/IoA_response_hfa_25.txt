### Island of Agreement (IoA) Table

#### Contested Facts:
1. The immediate necessity for HfA to redirect resources to Ukraine based on donor preferences.
2. The actual status of the detained staff - whether they are hostages or guests according to local customs.
3. The capacity and willingness of HfA to compensate local guards' families and fulfill other local commitments amidst financial constraints.
4. The operational sustainability of the Iguwafe hospital without HfA's presence.
5. The characterization of the tribal leaders' demands as extortion by HfA and its donors.

#### Agreed Facts:
1. HfA's mission has substantially benefited Iguwafe and its community.
2. The critical healthcare needs persist in Iguwafe, including surgery, measles outbreak management, and plastic surgeries for trauma patients.
3. The national government and local authorities’ limited capacity to fill the healthcare void left by HfA’s departure.
4. The local tribes and communities deeply value HfA's services and wish for their continuation.
5. The regional healthcare infrastructure remains fragile due to protracted community violence, natural disasters, and infectious disease outbreaks.

#### Convergent Norms:
1. The importance of ensuring the safety and well-being of the detained HfA staff.
2. Recognition of the crucial humanitarian role HfA plays in Iguwafe.
3. The shared desire between HfA, local communities, and tribal leaders for the restoration and continuation of necessary healthcare services.
4. The inherent value and respect for human life and the necessity of healthcare access for the population of Iguwafe.

#### Divergent Norms:
1. HfA’s policy prioritizing operations based on donor direction versus the local community's expectation for continued healthcare services regardless of geopolitical interest shifts.
2. The role of tribal leaders in healthcare operations and labor disputes within the hospital.
3. The obligations towards local guards' families and the extent of HfA’s responsibility in compensating them.

### Recommendations

#### Prioritize:
1. Ensuring the safety and immediate release of detained HfA staff by crafting a compelling mutual benefit argument for tribal leaders.
2. Establishing a temporary agreement that allows for the continuation of urgent healthcare services (e.g., addressing the measles outbreak and emergency surgeries) while longer-term solutions are negotiated.
3. Leveraging support from FWB and UN coordinators, given their understanding of local dynamics and available networks.
4. Exploring opportunities to engage development NGOs for transitioning the hospital operations, despite the noted challenges, to mitigate healthcare service disruption.
5. Initiating dialogue to address the compensation for local guards' families as a gesture of goodwill and acknowledgment of their sacrifices.

#### Avoid:
1. Disregarding the deepened local dependencies on HfA's presence and failing to recognize the magnitude of impact their departure causes.
2. Undermining tribal leaders' authority or bypassing their established communication protocols, as respect and adherence to local customs are critical for negotiation success.
3. Ignoring the broader healthcare crisis portrayed by the measles outbreak and the pressing surgical needs, highlighting the need for a responsible and phased withdrawal plan.
4. Dismissing the financial and operational challenges conveyed by HfA's main donors without attempting to negotiate flexibility or additional support focused on a transition plan.
5. Escalating the situation through actions perceived as hostile or disrespectful by tribal leaders and the community, potentially jeopardizing staff safety and long-term community relationships.
