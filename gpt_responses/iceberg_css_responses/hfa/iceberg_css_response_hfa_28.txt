Given the complexities of the negotiations between Health for All (HfA) and the tribal leaders in Iguwafe, here is a structured analysis based on the Iceberg and Common Shared Space (CSS) models focusing on three critical aspects: The detention of HfA staff, the closure of HfA operations and its consequences, and the demands for supporting the hospital's guards and addressing the measles outbreak.

### 1. Detention of HfA Staff

**User’s Organization (HfA):**
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Ensuring the safety and well-being of its staff, and commitment to humanitarian principles without succumbing to coercion.
