Given the complexity of the situation with Health for All (HfA) and the various stakeholders involved in the scenario in Iguwafe, a stakeholder map can provide a visual representation of the negotiation landscape. This roadmap will include HfA as the protagonist in this context, the tribesmen as the counterparty (due to direct opposition and detention of HfA staff), and other key stakeholders such as government officials, donor countries (Germany and Switzerland), other NGOs (like Food Without Borders and Child Protection International), the local hospital staff, local media, the Patient Association of Iguwafe, and the local guards.

Please find the Python `matplotlib` script below to generate the initial stakeholder map. This script plots each stakeholder based on their inclination towards change (from transformative to conservative) and their level of influence (from local to global). The stakeholders' positions on these axes are hypothetical and based on the narrative provided. You might need to adjust the positions based on further insights or clarification from your end.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Tribesmen')  # 'ro' for red circle, tribesmen as counterparty

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Plotting stakeholders, x (Transformative to Conservative), y (Local to Global Influence)
stakeholders = {
    'HfA': (3, 8),
    'Government Officials': (1, 7),
    'Donor Countries': (7, 10),
    'Other NGOs': (2, 6),
    'Local Hospital Staff': (-3, 3),
    'Local Media': (-5, 2),
    'Patient Association': (-2, 1),
    'Local Guards': (-4, 4)
}

# Plot each stakeholder
for label, (x, y) in stakeholders.items():
    ax.plot(x, y, 'bo')  # 'bo' for blue circle
    ax.text(x, y, ' {}'.format(label), verticalalignment='bottom')

# Adding labels to the points
ax.annotate('Tribesmen', (0,0), textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Setting the aspect of the plot to equal to make sure the axes scales are equal, which makes the circle look like circle
ax.set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')

# Show the plot (In a script, you might want to save the figure instead)
plt.show()
```

To use this script in your context, you can adjust the positions (x, y coordinates) of stakeholders according to your analysis of their roles, relationships, inclinations towards change, and their level of influence. This script assumes a generalized position for each stakeholder based on the narrative details and might need refinement to accurately reflect the complex negotiation landscape you are dealing with.

If necessary, further iterations can include plotting influence relationships and adjusting stakeholder positions based on detailed analysis or additional information.
