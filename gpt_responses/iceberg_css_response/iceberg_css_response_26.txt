### Aspect 1: Employment and Compensation of Local Guards for Food Ration Distribution

**Counterparty: Camp Authorities**

- **Positions (What):** Camp authorities demand that FWB hires local guards to assist in the food ration distribution process and compensates them with food rations.
- **Reasoning (How):** Authorities argue that guards' duties extend beyond security during distribution and that their families face food insecurity. The local economy's reliance on food rations as compensation necessitates this demand.
- **Motives and Values (Why):** The underlying motive is to sustain the local militia and their families, maintaining a socio-economic structure that consolidates their power and control within the camp, leveraging humanitarian aid for their benefit.

**User’s Organization: Food Without Borders (FWB)**

- **Motives and Values (Why):** FWB is committed to providing emergency food aid impartially and neutrally, aiming to prevent diversion of aid to ensure it reaches those truly in need.
- **Reasoning (How):** Hiring guards affiliated with the militia contradicts FWB’s mandate for neutrality and risks diverting aid from refugees to the militia network, undermining the effectiveness and fairness of the distribution process.
- **Positions (What):** FWB refuses to hire local militia members as guards and proposes to hire and vet its labor force independently, prioritizing local community members unaffiliated with the militia.

### Aspect 2: Method and Urgency of Food Distribution

**Counterparty: Camp Authorities**

- **Positions (What):** Camp authorities require immediate distribution based on their own data without further assessments, proposing a three-month distribution plan to alleviate pressure.
- **Reasoning (How):** Authorities seek to rapidly address visible symptoms of food insecurity to maintain order and possibly to leverage distribution timing and control for their interests.
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Ensuring the continuity of their power and mitigating risks of unrest or refugee mobility out of the camp that could challenge their control and the strategic positioning regarding the capital.

**User’s Organization: Food Without Borders (FWB)**

- **Motives and Values (Why):** FWB upholds the principle of conducting thorough assessments to ensure aid reaches those in dire need, maintaining donor trust, and ensuring the responsible use of resources.
- **Reasoning (How):** Conducting a nutritional assessment aligns with the organization’s methodical approach to aid delivery, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and adherence to donor stipulations.
- **Positions (What):** FWB insists on performing its comprehensive nutritional assessment despite camp authorities' demands for swift action, advocating for an informed and targeted response.

### Aspect 3: Security and Monitoring During Distribution

**Counterparty: Camp Authorities**

- **Positions (What):** Authorities insist on the presence of guards during distribution, controlling FWB's mobility within the camp.
- **Reasoning (How):** By controlling FWB's interactions with refugees, authorities aim to maintain narrative control and ensure their interests are not undermined.
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Protecting their authority and maintaining order as they define it, minimizing external influences that could empower refugees or challenge the existing power dynamics.

**User’s Organization: Food Without Borders (FWB)**

- **Motives and Values (Why):** FWB's adherence to principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence drives its operations, striving to ensure aid directly benefits those in need without unintended empowerment of local militias.
- **Reasoning (How):** FWB believes that unrestricted access to refugees allows for accurate needs assessment, direct dialogue, and effective aid distribution, enhancing transparency and accountability.
- **Positions (What):** FWB is seeking to negotiate terms that would allow its staff to operate without compulsory escort by guards, enabling free movement and engagement with refugees to facilitate direct aid distribution.
