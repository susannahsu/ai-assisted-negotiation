Based on the detailed case provided, the Island of Agreement (IoA) for the negotiation between Food Without Borders (FWB) and the camp authorities can be structured as follows:

**Contested Facts:**
- The necessity and methods for conducting a nutritional assessment within the camp.
- The impact and ethics of employing local guards, affiliated with armed militias, for food distribution.
- The methods and forms of compensation for laborers (including guards) involved in the food distribution process.
- The risk of diversion of food rations from intended beneficiaries to the local market.

**Agreed Facts:**
- The refugee camp houses over 160,000 displaced individuals, many facing food insecurity, malnutrition, and inadequate living conditions.
- FWB and camp authorities have a common goal of distributing food aid to mitigate hunger and malnutrition among the refugee population.
- Both parties recognize the importance of establishing a secure and efficient food distribution process.

**Convergent Norms:**
- Both parties recognize the urgent need for humanitarian assistance to the refugee population.
- There is a shared understanding that food assistance is essential for saving lives and restoring human dignity among the refugees.
- A common commitment to managing the food distribution process to alleviate the immediate needs of the refugee population.

**Divergent Norms:**
- FWB's principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence versus the camp authorities' demands to employ local guards as part of the food distribution.
- FWB's preference for cash payments to avoid food diversion contrasts with the camp authorities' insistence on food rations as compensation.
- The perspective on refugees’ rights and status, where FWB views them as individuals entitled to humanitarian assistance without discrimination, while the camp authorities, militia, and even the Alpha government have a more transactional or skeptical stance.

**Recommendations:**

**Prioritize:**
- Establishing a mutually acceptable framework for conducting a comprehensive nutritional assessment to ensure that food aid reaches those in dire need.
- Exploring alternative security arrangements that align with FWB's principles while addressing the camp authorities' security concerns.
- Engaging with independent third parties, like other international organizations or neutral local entities, to facilitate food distribution and monitoring.
- Developing a transparent and accountable compensation system that reduces the risk of aid diversion, potentially including the involvement of third-party oversight.

**Avoid:**
- Conceding to demands that compromise FWB’s neutrality, impartiality, and independence, such as directly employing militia-affiliated guards for food distribution.
- Ignoring the potential risks and ethical implications of food diversion, both in terms of compensation practices and the resale of food rations in local markets.
- Overlooking local dynamics, including the influence of the militia, local government positions, and the refugees’ perspectives, in planning and executing the food distribution.
- Rushing into agreements without ensuring they align with humanitarian principles and the organization's operational policies.
