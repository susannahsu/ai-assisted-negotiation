- addressing the compensation claims of the local guards' families to acknowledge their contributions and sacrifices.
- ensuring the immediate safety and planned release of the detained hfa staff through goodwill gestures and constructive dialogue.

 avoid:

- making commitments that hfa cannot feasibly honor in the long term, to avoid future disputes and mistrust.
- public or external pressures that could embarrass the tribal leaders or undermine their standing within the community.
- any actions or statements that could be perceived as bypassing the established dialogue channels with the tribal leadership.
