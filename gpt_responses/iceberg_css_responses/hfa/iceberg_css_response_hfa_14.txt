Considering the complex scenario involving Health for All (HfA) and the tribal leaders of Iguwafe, it's imperative to structure the negotiation process around three core aspects: the detention of HfA staff, the continuity of medical services in Iguwafe, and compensation for local guards and their families. The following points crystallize the positions, reasoning, motives, and values for both the counterparty (tribal leaders) and HfA.

### Aspect 1: Detention of HfA Staff

**Counterparty (Tribal Leaders):**
- **Positions:** Insists on keeping HfA staff detained until an agreement is reached.
- **Reasoning:** Utilizes detention as leverage to ensure HfA addresses their demands.
- **Motives and Values:** Prioritize community well-being and healthcare continuity; view the situation as a means to negotiate healthcare services continuation.

**User’s Organization (HfA):**
- **Motives and Values:** Prioritize staff safety, healthcare mission adherence, and organizational integrity.
- **Reasoning:** Seeks a diplomatic solution to ensure staff release without compromising its policies (e.g., no-ransom policy).
- **Positions:** Demands the immediate safe release of its staff to resume operations or negotiate an exit.

### Aspect 2: Continuity of Medical Services in Iguwafe

**Counterparty (Tribal Leaders):**
- **Positions:** Wants HfA to commit to continuing medical services in response to community needs.
- **Reasoning:** Believes HfA's operations are essential for countering health crises (e.g., measles outbreak).
- **Motives and Values:** Committed to the well-being and health security of the community.

**User’s Organization (HfA):**
- **Motives and Values:** Dedicated to providing medical aid where most needed, but constrained by donor focus and global priorities.
- **Reasoning:** Contemplates a strategic realignment of resources due to donor pressure, yet open to negotiation to ensure some level of continuity or transition of services.
- **Positions:** Attempts to negotiate terms for either phasing out or transitioning services to local entities or another NGO, balancing global demands with local needs.

### Aspect 3: Compensation for Local Guards and Their Families

**Counterparty (Tribal Leaders):**
- **Positions:** Seeks compensation for the families of guards who have been killed or injured.
- **Reasoning:** Argues that these guards' sacrifices enabled HfA’s operations and protected its staff.
- **Motives and Values:** Values justice and compensation for loss, recognizing the guards' contributions to the community and HfA’s success.

**User’s Organization (HfA):**
- **Motives and Values:** Acknowledges the guards' sacrifices and the importance of supporting families affected by the crisis.
- **Reasoning:** Evaluates the feasibility of compensation within organizational policies and financial constraints, aiming to address grievances.
- **Positions:** Willing to engage in discussions to explore compensation mechanisms, potentially through collaboration with local authorities or NGOs to find a sustainable solution.

### Next Steps:

HfA's Geneva delegation should employ a multi-faceted strategy to address these aspects, factoring in the need for a balanced approach that secures the staff's safety, explores potential for medical services' continuity or transition, and recognizes the sacrifices of local guards and their families. Diplomatic engagement, collaboration with other NGOs, local authorities, and donors, alongside innovative problem-solving, may collectively offer a pathway out of the current impasse.
