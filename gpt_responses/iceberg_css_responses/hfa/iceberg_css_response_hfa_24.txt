Based on the extensive background provided, the negotiation landscape between Health for All (HfA) and the tribesmen in Iguwafe is highly complex, involving critical healthcare services, ethnic tensions, and international priorities. The situation is further compounded by the enforced house arrest of HfA staff and the broader implications for the local healthcare infrastructure and international humanitarian efforts. Here's a structured approach to understanding the positions, reasoning, and underlying values of both parties, focusing on three primary aspects of the negotiation: The Continuation of Healthcare Services, Safety and Release of HfA Staff, and Compensation for Local Guards' Families.

### The Continuation of Healthcare Services

**Counterparty: Tribesmen and Local Community**

- **Positions (What):** Demand the continuation of HfA operations in Iguwafe.
  
- **Reasoning (How):** The local healthcare infrastructure heavily relies on HfA for surgical and emergency care, vaccinations, and dealing with outbreaks like measles.
  
- **Motives and Values (Why):** The underlying motive is the welfare and health of the local community, which has already been significantly impacted by protracted violence and inadequate healthcare access. The value here is community well-being and survival.

**User’s Organization: Health for All (HfA)**

- **Motives and Values (Why):** HfA is driven by the need to provide critical healthcare services to conflict-stricken areas, but also by the practicality of funding constraints and donor priorities.
  
- **Reasoning (How):** The strategic shift towards Ukraine is based on donor pressure, but there's an acknowledgement of the critical healthcare role HfA plays in Iguwafe.
  
- **Positions (What):** Willing to engage with tribal leaders to find a compromise that may allow for the continuation of some healthcare services, possibly through a transition to local health authorities or finding a developmental NGO partner.

### Safety and Release of HfA Staff

**Counterparty: Tribesmen and Local Community**

- **Positions (What):** Conditional release of HfA staff based on the organization's commitments to continue healthcare services and address other demands.
  
- **Reasoning (How):** Using the staff as leverage to ensure HfA addresses the healthcare crisis left in their wake.
  
- **Motives and Values (Why):** The safety of the community is paramount, with the staff's detainment serving as a means to secure immediate attention to their healthcare needs.

**User’s Organization: Health for All (HfA)**

- **Motives and Values (Why):** Prioritizing the safety, security, and well-being of its staff while ensuring the continuity of healthcare services in conflict or post-conflict zones.
  
- **Reasoning (How):** Open to negotiation to secure the release of staff and possibly reinstate some level of service provision in collaboration with local partners.
  
- **Positions (What):** Seeking a peaceful resolution for the staff's release through dialogue and negotiations, without succumbing to actions that might set a problematic precedent, such as ransom payments.

### Compensation for Local Guards' Families

**Counterparty: Tribesmen and Local Community**

- **Positions (What):** Demand for compensation for the families of local guards who were killed or injured while protecting HfA operations.
  
- **Reasoning (How):** The guards played a crucial role in ensuring HfA's operational security, and their families are now vulnerable due to their loss.
  
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Justice and acknowledgment of sacrifices made by the local community for the sake of maintaining essential healthcare services.

**User’s Organization: Health for All (HfA)**

- **Motives and Values (Why):** Recognition of the contributions and sacrifices made by local staff and guards in facilitating HfA's mission. Ethical responsibility towards those who supported their operations.
  
- **Reasoning (How):** Understanding the need to address grievances as part of maintaining a sustainable and respectful relationship with the communities they serve.
  
- **Positions (What):** Intent to find a practical and ethical solution to compensate or support the affected families, contingent upon the resolution of the current crisis and possibly through collaboration with other NGOs or local authorities.

In navigating these negotiations, it will be crucial for HfA to balance their immediate operational priorities with their long-term commitment to healthcare provision in conflict-affected areas, all while upholding their core values of dignity, impartiality, and respect for local partnerships.
