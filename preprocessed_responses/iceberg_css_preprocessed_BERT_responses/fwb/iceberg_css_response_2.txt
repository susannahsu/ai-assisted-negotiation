 aspect [NUMBER]: distribution of food aid

counterparty (camp authorities):

- positions: demand that food without borders (fwb) hires local guards for food ration distribution and compensates them with food rations.
- reasoning: security concerns within the camp require guard presence; the guards and their families face food insecurity, making food rations a suitable form of compensation.
- motives and values: ensuring control and security within the camp while addressing the immediate needs of the guards and their families.

user’s organization (fwb):

- motives and values: fwb is dedicated to providing impartial humanitarian aid, aiming to distribute food aid efficiently and neutrally.
- reasoning: hiring guards affiliated with militias contradicts fwb's principles of neutrality and risks diverting aid from its intended beneficiaries.
- positions: fwb insists on direct distribution of food to refugees without involving local guards, preferring employment of vetted community members instead.

 aspect [NUMBER]: employment and compensation

counterparty (camp authorities):

- positions: insist that local guards are employed for distribution tasks and compensated with food rations.
- reasoning: the employment and compensation through food of guards is considered essential for maintaining camp security and supporting the guards' families.
- motives and values: prioritizing the welfare of guards (and by extension, their militia affiliations) and maintaining control over the camp’s operations.

user’s organization (fwb):

- motives and values: uphold transparency and accountability in aid distribution, ensuring aid reaches those most in need without diversion.
- reasoning: employing and compensating individuals directly (ideally in cash) to circumvent potential aid diversion, and maintain organizational principles of neutrality.
- positions: fwb seeks alternative labor solutions and rejects the compensation of workers with food rations to prevent aid diversion.

 aspect [NUMBER]: nutritional assessment and strategic operation

counterparty (camp authorities):

- positions: reject the need for a new nutritional assessment by fwb, demanding immediate food distribution.
- reasoning: aiming to quickly alleviate food shortages and potentially avoid scrutiny that could reveal misallocation of resources or corruption.
- motives and values: seeking to maintain operational control and possibly mask the diversion of resources, prioritizing the appearance of addressing the crisis.

user’s organization (fwb):

- motives and values: committed to conducting operations based on accurate and current data to ensure aid effectiveness and uphold donor stipulations.
- reasoning: a thorough nutritional assessment allows for targeted food aid, fulfilling donor requirements and ensuring aid reaches those in dire need.
- positions: fwb insists on conducting its own nutritional assessment prior to distribution to ensure an informed and effective response to the crisis.
