This Python script will generate a stakeholder map based on the context provided by the various meetings and interactions concerning Health for All (HfA) and their situation in Iguwafe. Each stakeholder is placed on the map according to their negotiation position and level of impact, from local to global influence and from transformative to conservative objectives with regard to the negotiation context. Ensure to run this in an environment where matplotlib is installed and adjust the `os.path.join` as necessary for your file system.
