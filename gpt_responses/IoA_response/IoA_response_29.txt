Based on the comprehensive information provided, here's the Island of Agreement (IoA) table for the negotiation between Food Without Borders (FWB) and the camp authorities:

**Contested Facts:**
- FWB believes a nutritional assessment is necessary for effective aid distribution, whereas the Camp Commander views existing data as sufficient.
- The camp authorities demand FWB to employ local guards for food distribution, conflicting with FWB's neutrality and independence principles.
- Camp authorities propose compensating guards with food rations, which contradicts FWB policies due to concerns over aid diversion.
- The Camp Commander and local militia view the provision of food aid to guards as equally important as providing for refugees, a stance FWB disagrees with due to their impartiality policy.
- FWB's insistence on hiring and vetting its own workforce is met with resistance, with camp authorities demanding the employment of guards.

**Agreed Facts:**
- The camp's population, exceeding 160,000 refugees, faces severe food insecurity and nutritional deficiencies.
- Health conditions in the camp are dire, with reports of malnutrition, inadequate shelter, and lack of clean water.
- Both parties acknowledge the urgent need for food aid distribution to alleviate the refugees' suffering.
- The refugees are confined to the camp, relying on humanitarian aid, as indicated by both FWB's findings and camp authorities' acknowledgments.

**Convergent Norms:**
- The humanitarian obligation to provide aid and restore dignity to the displaced refugees.
- Recognition of the urgent need for food assistance to prevent further humanitarian crises within the camp.
- Acknowledgement of security concerns within the camp, as both parties have expressed the importance of ensuring safe and orderly distribution processes.

**Divergent Norms:**
- FWB's adherence to neutrality, independence, and impartiality conflicts with the camp authorities' demand for employing local guards and compensating them with food rations.
- The definitions of "beneficiaries" differ, with camp authorities insisting guards are also deserving of aid, whereas FWB prioritizes refugees.
- The appropriate process for identifying beneficiaries and distributing aid, especially regarding the need for a nutritional assessment.

---

**Recommendations:**

- **Prioritize:**
  - Establishing a mutually agreeable third-party mechanism to conduct the nutritional assessment, ensuring both FWB's and the camp authorities' requirements are met without compromising on the quality and impartiality of the aid distribution process.
  - Negotiating an alternative agreement that allows FWB to maintain its principles while possibly offering non-food aid or support to guards in a manner that does not detract from refugee assistance.
  - Developing a detailed, transparent, and secure food distribution plan that addresses the security concerns of the camp authorities without necessitating the employment of local guards by FWB.
  - Leveraging international diplomatic pressure or seeking the involvement of other humanitarian organizations to negotiate more favorable terms for FWB's operations within the camp.
  
- **Avoid:**
  - Compromising on FWB's core principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence, as this could set a concerning precedent for future negotiations and operations.
  - Ignoring the potential for aid diversion, which could undermine the effectiveness of the humanitarian mission and the dignity of the aid recipients.
  - Disregarding the refugee population's stance and experiences with the local guards, as their trust and cooperation are crucial for the successful distribution of aid.
  - Engaging in actions that could escalate tensions with the camp authorities or the local militia, thereby endangering FWB staff, the refugee population, and the overall mission.
