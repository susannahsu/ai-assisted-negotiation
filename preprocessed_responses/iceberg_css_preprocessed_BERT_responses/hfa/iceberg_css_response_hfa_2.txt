further consideration and approach:
hfa should approach negotiations with fully acknowledging the consequences of its planned exit and work towards arranging sustainable healthcare solutions, respecting the tribe's roles and influences in the community. the process should focus on fostering a spirit of collaboration, emphasizing mutual concerns for community well-being, and finding feasible compromises that align with hfa's organizational capacity and the urgent healthcare needs of the iguwafe community. establishing clear, achievable timelines and commitments on both sides will be essential for rebuilding trust and moving towards a resolution.
