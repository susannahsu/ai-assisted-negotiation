  [NUMBER]. the requirement of a peaceful and orderly method for distributing food rations to avoid further exacerbating the vulnerable condition of the refugees.

- divergent norms:

recommendations:

- prioritize:
  [NUMBER]. establishing an updated, independent nutritional assessment to ensure that the aid reaches those in most need.
  [NUMBER]. seeking alternative solutions for workforce recruitment that maintains fwb’s neutrality, such as involving external third-party oversight or international community support.
  [NUMBER]. working towards a mutual agreement on security protocol that allows fwb staff to move freely without compromising the security of the operations, like having identified neutral observers.
  [NUMBER]. exploring alternative compensation mechanisms for local workers that don’t directly contradict fwb’s policies, possibly through intermediary goods or services that can benefit the guards but are not food rations.

- avoid:
  [NUMBER]. ceding to demands that compromise fwb's principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.
  [NUMBER]. any form of compensation that risks diverting aid from its intended beneficiaries or could be exploited by militia members.
  [NUMBER]. overlooking the value of comprehensive, current nutritional assessments which could lead to misallocation of resources.
  [NUMBER]. ignoring the potential for leveraging international pressure or support to mitigate the influence of the militia and camp authorities on the operation.
