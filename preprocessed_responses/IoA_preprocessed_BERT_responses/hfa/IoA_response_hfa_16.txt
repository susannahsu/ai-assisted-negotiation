 island of agreement (ioa) table

contested facts:
- hfa's decision to close trauma operations in beta with limited local consultation.
- the misconception that detained staff are hostages rather than being treated as guests according to local traditions.
- the true intention behind hfa's rapid operational shift to ukraine without discussing viable transition plans for the local hospital.
- the capacity and willingness of local health authorities to take over hfa's operations amid the measles outbreak.
- claims and perspectives regarding hfa's contributions and responsibilities towards the local guards and their families.

agreed facts:
- hfa played a crucial role in providing surgical and healthcare services amidst the ethnic clashes in beta.
- there is an immediate need for healthcare services in iguwafe, including surgeries and combating the measles outbreak.
- international organizations, including hfa, significantly support the healthcare infrastructure in conflict or post-conflict regions like beta.
- the government of beta and tribal leaders have limited resources and capabilities to fill the void left by hfa's departure.
- the detained hfa staff's well-being and security are a priority for both hfa and the tribal leaders.


convergent norms:
- ensuring the safety and security of healthcare workers operating in conflict or post-conflict zones.
- the moral obligation to provide healthcare to vulnerable populations, especially in regions with limited access to medical services.
- recognition of the sacrifices made by local guards and the importance of addressing their families' needs.
- the importance of engaging with local stakeholders, including tribal leaders and the patient community, to ensure sustainable healthcare delivery.
- upholding the principle of medical neutrality and ensuring healthcare initiatives are not politicized.


divergent norms:
- hfa’s policy of not negotiating under threats or paying ransoms versus tribal leaders' demands for specific commitments before releasing staff.
- the perception of hfa's departure as a form of humanitarian colonialism versus hfa’s operational priorities dictated by donor constraints and global demands.
- the role and influence of tribal leaders in healthcare management and labor disputes within the healthcare sector.
- prioritization of humanitarian aid – immediate conflict-related crises versus sustainable development in healthcare infrastructure.


 recommendations

prioritize:
- engaging in direct, respectful dialogue with tribal leaders and local stakeholders to address the immediate crisis and negotiate the release of detained staff.
- committing to short-term medical support to address the measles outbreak and emergency surgical needs as a gesture of goodwill and shared responsibility.
- exploring partnerships with local ngos, government health agencies, or international organizations to ensure continuity of care post-hfa departure.
- transparent communication regarding hfa's operational constraints and seeking mutual understanding with the local community and donors about realistic transition plans.

avoid:
- further actions that could be perceived as disrespectful or undermining the authority of tribal leaders and local customs.
- making commitments hfa cannot fulfill given the donor constraints and strategic focus on ukraine, which could exacerbate trust issues.
- neglecting the concerns and needs of the local guards’ families and the broader patient community, as it could lead to deeper resentment and complications.
- allowing the negotiation to be solely about the detainment situation without addressing the underlying healthcare service void and community needs.
