Based on the provided information, here is how the Island of Agreement (IoA) table can be populated and the recommended negotiation strategies:

**Island of Agreement Table:**

- **Contested Facts:**
    1. The necessity and conditions for HfA's continued operation in Iguwafe.
    2. The extent of HfA’s responsibilities towards local hospital guards and their families.
    3. The feasibility of HfA’s immediate transition of hospital control to local health authorities amidst current outbreaks, like measles.
    4. The characterization of HfA staff detention — labor dispute or hostage crisis.

- **Agreed Facts:**
    1. HfA provided invaluable surgical and medical services in the wake of community violence.
    2. The local health infrastructure is inadequate to meet the community's needs without external support.
    3. The local population, especially children, critically needs ongoing surgical and medical support.
    4. The immediate release and safety of HfA staff is a priority for HfA.

- **Convergent Norms:**
    1. Acknowledgment of the indispensable role of humanitarian organizations in addressing health crises in conflict and post-conflict situations.
    2. The principle of ensuring the safety and security of humanitarian workers.
    3. The immediate need to address health outbreaks (e.g., measles) which poses a significant risk to the local population.
    4. Recognition of the sacrifices and dangers faced by local guards during HfA operations.

- **Divergent Norms:**
    1. HfA’s priority to reallocate resources to other global crises (e.g., Ukraine) vs. the local community's demand for continued healthcare support.
    2. Views on the appropriate compensation and acknowledgment for the local guards and their families.
    3. Differing perspectives on the legal and ethical implications of HfA staff detention.

**Recommendations:**

- **Prioritize:**
    1. Securing the immediate release of detained HfA staff through diplomatic engagement and community dialogue, without escalating tensions or validating the detention through financial negotiation.
    2. Establishing a transition plan for healthcare services that includes a temporary reduction rather than complete cessation of services, leveraging support from other NGOs, national government efforts, and potential donor flexibility.
    3. Engaging with local authorities, tribal leaders, and other stakeholders to outline a sustainable healthcare model for Iguwafe, which may include training and empowering local health professionals.
    4. Addressing the measles outbreak as an immediate health crisis requiring collaborative intervention, potentially as a gesture of goodwill and to underscore the necessity of HfA’s presence.

- **Avoid:**
    1. Any concession that may be perceived as a ransom or that compromises the principles of neutrality and independence of humanitarian work.
    2. Public confrontation or media engagement that could further inflame local sentiments or endanger the detained staff.
    3. Underestimating the influence of tribal leaders and local customs in the resolution of the crisis.
    4. Delaying negotiation or responses to urgent health needs, such as the measles outbreak, which could deteriorate local trust and escalate demands.
