    3. Underestimating the complexity of the situation by treating it solely as a labor dispute.
    4. Making commitments that HfA cannot fulfill due to donor restrictions or operational capabilities.
    5. Ignoring the broader impact of HfA’s departure on the local healthcare ecosystem and community trust.
