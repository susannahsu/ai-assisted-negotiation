This Python script creates a stakeholder map for the scenario involving Food Without Borders (FWB) assisting refugees in Alpha, based on the extensive background and details provided. The script places key stakeholders like the camp authorities, FWB, and various other entities on a graph that juxtaposes their stance on transformation versus conservation and gauges their influence from a local to global scale. The positions assigned to these stakeholders are informed by the narrative shared, illustrating the complex dynamics FWB navigates in its mission to deliver humanitarian aid.
