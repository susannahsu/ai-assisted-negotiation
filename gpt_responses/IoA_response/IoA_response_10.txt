Based on the detailed information provided regarding the situation involving Food Without Borders (FWB), camp authorities, and other stakeholders in the refugee camp in Country Alpha, here is the Island of Agreement (IoA) table and recommended negotiation strategies:

### Contested Facts:
1. The necessity of hiring local guards for the distribution process.
2. Appropriateness and sufficiency of camp's existing data on population nutritional status.
3. The effectiveness and neutrality of aid distribution with the involvement of local guards.
4. The actual nutritional and health status of the refugee population based on conflicting reports.
5. The validity of trading food rations for services or goods within the camp's economy.

### Agreed Facts:
1. Over 160,000 forcibly displaced refugees are present in the primary camp.
2. The refugee population includes large numbers of children and women facing severe nutritional deficiencies.
3. Continuous arrival of new refugees in the camp.
4. The presence of extensive food insecurity among refugees.
5. FWB's offering of emergency food aid has been accepted by camp authorities.

### Convergent Norms:
1. The imperative of providing urgent food assistance to the refugee population.
2. Recognition of the necessity for a structured distribution plan for the emergency food aid.
3. Acknowledgment of the general need for relief assistance to reach refugees effectively.

### Divergent Norms:
1. FWB's employment policy versus the camp authorities' demand to hire local guards.
2. Distribution method of aid (direct distribution by FWB vs. involvement of local guards).
3. Compensation methods (FWB prefers cash payments; camp authorities insist on food rations).
4. Perspectives on the refugee status and associated rights (as seen by Alpha's government vs. FWB's humanitarian view).

### Recommendations for Negotiation

#### Prioritize:
1. Establishing a clear, transparent mechanism for aid distribution that ensures aid reaches the intended beneficiaries without diversion.
2. Seeking common ground on alternative methods for involving the local community in the distribution process that do not compromise FWB's principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.
3. Implementing a third-party monitoring system to oversee the distribution process and ensure compliance with agreed terms.
4. Leveraging support from international bodies or neutral stakeholders to act as mediators if necessary.
5. Establishing a direct channel of communication with refugee leaders to accurately assess needs and ensure that their voices are heard in planning and execution phases.

#### Avoid:
1. Employment of guards with potential affiliations to armed militias, ensuring adherence to FWB's principles and mitigating risks of aid diversion.
2. Making concessions that would enable camp authorities to exert control over aid distribution beyond security concerns.
3. Agreeing to compensation in forms that could potentially enable the diversion of aid from its intended beneficiaries.
4. Rushing the verification process related to the nutritional assessment and the comprehensive identification of beneficiaries, to ensure aid effectiveness.
5. Ignoring the broader political context and potential implications of decisions on FWB's operational capacity and reputation.
