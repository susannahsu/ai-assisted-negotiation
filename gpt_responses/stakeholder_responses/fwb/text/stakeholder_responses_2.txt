This script creates a stakeholder map based on the complex negotiation scenario involving FWB's effort to distribute food to refugees while navigating challenges posed by local authorities, militias, and international stakeholders. Each party is plotted according to their orientation towards change and their local to global influence, clarifying the negotiation landscape FWB is operating within.
