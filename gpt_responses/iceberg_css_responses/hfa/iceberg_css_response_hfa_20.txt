Given the complex situation involving the international health organization Health for All (HfA) and the local tribesmen in Iguwafe, Country Beta, the negotiation landscape can be framed using the Iceberg and Common Shared Space (CSS) models. The provided context highlights critical aspects of this high-stakes negotiation, focusing on the detention of HfA's staff, the healthcare needs of the local population, and the demands of the tribal leaders.
