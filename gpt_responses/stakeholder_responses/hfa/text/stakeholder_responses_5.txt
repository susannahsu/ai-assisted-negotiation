In light of the complex situation involving the international health organization Health for All (HfA) and various stakeholders in Iguwafe, Country Beta, a detailed stakeholder mapping is instrumental in visualizing the negotiation landscape. This analysis closely examines the escalation around HfA's intended departure and subsequent events, identifying key parties, their stances, and potential negotiation paths.

Given the multitude of stakeholders involved, here is a proposed stakeholder mapping approach:

1. **Primary Party (Protagonist in Negotiation Context)**: Health for All (HfA)
2. **Counterparty (Opposing the Primary Party)**: Armed Tribesmen - This group directly opposes HfA's plans by detaining their staff, representing the most immediate and tangible opposition.

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party (Armed Tribesmen)
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Armed Tribesmen')  # 'ro' for red circle

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

This stakeholder map initiative captures the varying objectives and influence levels of stakeholders involved in HfA's crisis in Iguwafe. By positioning these parties based on their inclination towards change and their local to global influence, negotiation pathways can be explored more efectively:

- **Protagonist Positioning**: HfA is placed towards transformative objectives due to their shifting operational focus to Ukraine, representing a significant change in their mission's geographical focus.
  
- **Counterparty Positioning**: Armed Tribesmen are at the origin, opposing HfA's departure and leading to the detention of their staff.

- **Government of Beta and Donors**: Positioned to reflect their global influence and varied stances on HfA's operations.

- **Local Entities' Inclinations**: Entities like the Local Hospital Staff, Tribal Leaders, and the Local Community reflect more conservative inclinations, emphasizing the continuation of HfA's services in Iguwafe.

### Next Steps:
- **Engage Key Local Stakeholders**: Armed Tribesmen, Tribal Leaders, and Government Officials in dialogue facilitated by international bodies like UN Agencies.
- **Explore Compromise Solutions**: Maintenance of essential services, transition of operations, and addressing local guards' compensation.
  
Before progressing, it's critical to obtain feedback and verify stakeholder positions to ensure an accurate representation of the situational dynamics.
