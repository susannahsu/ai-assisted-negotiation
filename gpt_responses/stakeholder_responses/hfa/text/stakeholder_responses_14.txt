This script generates a stakeholder map for the situation involving the Health for All (HfA) staff detained by tribesmen in Iguwafe. The map visualizes various stakeholders such as the Tribal Leaders, Government of Beta, Donors (Germany and Switzerland), UN Coordinator, Local Hospital Staff, and Patients' Association, plotted based on their objectives (transformative to conservative) and identity (local to global influence). The counterparty, in this case, the Tribal Leaders, is placed at the origin and marked in red, with HfA represented by a green dot, indicating their primary interest in resolving the situation.
