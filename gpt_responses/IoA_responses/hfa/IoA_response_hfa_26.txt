Based on the detailed situation involving Health for All (HfA) and the stakeholders in Iguwafe, here is the Island of Agreement (IoA) analysis:

### Contested Facts:
- HfA's sudden decision and poor communication regarding the cessation of its operations in Beta.
- The tribal leaders' contention that HfA has obligations towards the local guards' families.
- The misunderstanding regarding the status of detained HfA staff (hostage situation vs. labor dispute).

### Agreed Facts:
- HfA has been instrumental in providing surgical care and addressing the healthcare needs in Iguwafe amidst security challenges.
- The local healthcare infrastructure is heavily impacted by protracted violence and lacks capabilities to meet the population's needs without NGOs' support.
- Rising measles cases in the region are concerning, and immediate healthcare interventions are required.
- The local tribal leadership and community deeply value HfA's contribution to healthcare in the district.

### Convergent Norms:
- The safety and well-being of the detained HfA staff are of paramount importance to all parties.
- Healthcare access is recognized as a critical need for the population of Iguwafe by both HfA and the tribal leaders.
- All parties demonstrate a commitment to dialogue as a means to resolve the current crisis.

### Divergent Norms:
- HfA's policy of reallocating resources to other conflict zones, given the evolving needs in Iguwafe versus the local expectation for continued support.
- Compensation for local guards and their families seen as HfA's responsibility versus HfA's view of its mission limits.
- The local tribal leaders' involvement in healthcare service continuation versus HfA's operational decisions driven by donor demands and global priorities.

### Recommendations:

#### Prioritize:
- Direct negotiations with tribal leaders to ensure the safe release of HfA staff with clear commitments on non-ransom.
- Developing an interim operational plan that provides measles vaccination and essential surgical services while seeking a sustainable transition to local or other NGO operation.
- Establishing a clear communication strategy to manage expectations about HfAâ€™s future involvement in Iguwafe.
- Identifying potential partnership with organizations like Swisscross for specialized services like plastic surgery for children.
- Setting up a task force to explore compensation for the families of the deceased guards, possibly in collaboration with other NGOs or international bodies.

#### Avoid:
- Publicly challenging the tribal leaders or disputing their authority in the process; this will only escalate tensions.
- Making commitments that HfA cannot realistically honor due to the constraints imposed by their funding conditions and mission focus.
- Delaying the negotiation with the tribal leaders and other local stakeholders, as this may further endanger the safety of the staff and the health of the population needing medical care.
- Ignoring the broad spectrum of healthcare needs in the district, including non-surgical ones like infectious disease outbreaks.

Following these guidelines will help HfA navigate the complex negotiation landscape in Iguwafe, balance competing demands, and hopefully lead to a resolution that safeguards both its staff and the ongoing healthcare needs of the local population.
