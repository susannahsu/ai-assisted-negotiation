Based on the detailed scenario involving Health for All (HfA) and its negotiations in Iguwafe, the stakeholder map needs to accurately reflect the positions and relationships of involved parties, considering the inclination towards change, and their local to global influence. Here is a Python `matplotlib` script to visualize this complex scenario:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counterparty at the origin
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Local Armed Tribesmen')  # Counterparty always plotted at the origin

# Define positions for other stakeholders based on their negotiation stance and influence level
positions = {
    'HfA': (5, 7),
    'Tribal Leaders': (2, 5),
    'Local Government': (7, 3),
    'Patient Association': (3, 6),
    'German Government': (9, 8),
    'Swiss Government': (8, 7),
    'FWB': (4, 4),
    'UN Agencies': (6, 9),
    'CPI': (4, 8),
    'Local Guards and Families': (1, 3),
    'Local Hospital Staff': (2, 2),
    'Measles Outbreak/Health Crisis': (-4, 1),  # Representing a challenge needing transformative action
}

# Plot each stakeholder
for party, pos in positions.items():
    ax.plot(pos[0], pos[1], 'bo')  # 'bo' for blue circle represents stakeholders
    ax.annotate(party, (pos[0], pos[1]), textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Adjust the axes to add clarity
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical line

# Adding label for counterparty for clarity
ax.annotate('Local Armed Tribesmen', (0, 0), textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,-15), ha='center', color='red')

# Show the plot
output_file_path = 'C:/path/to/your/directory/'  # Modify as needed
plt.savefig(output_file_path + 'stakeholder_map.png')

plt.show()
```

This script provides a visual representation of the stakeholders and their positions related to the HfA's negotiation context in Iguwafe. It reflects the various dynamics at play, such as the inclination towards conserving resources or transforming health service delivery, and the differing levels of influence, from local to global. Modify the `output_file_path` with the actual path where you wish to save the plot for future discussions and strategic planning.
