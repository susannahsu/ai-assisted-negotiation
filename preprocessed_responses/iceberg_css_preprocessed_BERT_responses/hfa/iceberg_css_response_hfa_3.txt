given the complex situation involving the health for all (hfa) organization's staff detained by tribesmen in iguwafe and the broader context of hfa's planned withdrawal from the area, below is a negotiation analysis using the iceberg and common shared space (css) models to structure discussions with the tribal leaders for resolving the crisis.

 aspect [NUMBER]: continuation of healthcare services

counterparty (tribal leaders) position:
- positions (what): demand for the immediate resumption of healthcare services at the local hospital and an assurance of hfa's continued presence in iguwafe.
- reasoning (how): the sudden withdrawal of hfa has left a vacuum in healthcare services, exacerbating local healthcare crises such as measles outbreaks.
- motives and values (why): preservation of community health and welfare, upholding the communal responsibility to provide care, especially in light of past sacrifices made by local guards.

user’s organization (hfa) position:
- motives and values (why): command a strong commitment to health care provision in crisis zones, and a principle of non-abandonment of communities in need.
- reasoning (how): acknowledging the impact of their withdrawal on the community’s access to healthcare, and understanding the need to build a sustainable transition to local or government-handled healthcare services.
- positions (what): willingness to negotiate terms for gradual withdrawal that ensures the least disruption to local healthcare services, possibly through training local staff or securing a partner organization to take over operations.

 aspect [NUMBER]: safety and release of detained staff

counterparty (tribal leaders) position:
- positions (what): detention of international staff as leverage to negotiate hfa’s continued presence and healthcare services delivery.
- reasoning (how): using the detention as a means to attract attention to their demands and bring hfa to the negotiating table.
- motives and values (why): leverage for negotiations; ensuring the welfare and safety of their community by maintaining healthcare services.

user’s organization (hfa) position:
- motives and values (why): ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of their staff; fulfilling healthcare commitments without fostering a precedent for future coercion.
- reasoning (how): prioritizing staff safety through dialogues and negotiations without succumbing to extortion tactics to maintain the principle of impartiality and non-ransom policy.
- positions (what): seeking immediate release of the staff through negotiation while discussing sustainable, long-term solutions for the community’s healthcare needs.

 aspect [NUMBER]: compensation for local guards

counterparty (tribal leaders) position:
- positions (what): demand for compensation for the hospital’s guards and their families who faced risks and losses due to their association with hfa.
- reasoning (how): these demands are based on the perceived obligation of hfa to recognize and remunerate the sacrifices made by the local guards for the safety of hfa operations.
- motives and values (why): justice and recognition for the community members’ sacrifices; ensuring families of deceased or disabled guards are cared for.

user’s organization (hfa) position:
- motives and values (why): recognition of the contributions and sacrifices of local guards to hfa’s operations; commitment to ethical conduct and community support.
- reasoning (how): understanding the importance of local guards in their operations, and the need to ethically address the consequences of their withdrawal on these individuals and their families.
- positions (what): openness to discuss and find feasible ways to compensate or assist the families of the local guards, within the constraints of hfa’s policies and capabilities.

in negotiating with the tribal leaders, hfa should leverage the css model to find a shared space of interests—healthcare continuity, staff safety, and guard compensation—and work towards solutions that respect both parties’ motives and values, facilitating a sustainable transition and ensuring the well-being of the iguwafe community and hfa staff.
