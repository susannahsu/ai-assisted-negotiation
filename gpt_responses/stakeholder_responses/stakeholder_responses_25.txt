This Python script creates a stakeholder map visualizing the positions of different parties involved in the negotiation and food aid distribution process by the Food Without Borders (FWB) within a refugee camp in Country Alpha. The camp authorities are marked as the counterparty at the origin, representing their pivotal role and oppositional stance in this scenario.

Each stakeholder's position on the map is defined according to their inclination towards the negotiation's objectives (x-axis: transformative to conservative) and their identity (y-axis: local to global influence). The positions are contextual estimates based on the provided information, aiming to reflect stakeholders' roles and attitudes towards the planned food aid distribution.

Should you need adjustments or additional details represented in the map, please let me know to provide an updated visualization or additional analyses.
