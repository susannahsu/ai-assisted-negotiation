Based on the extensive background information provided, we'll proceed with mapping the stakeholders involved in the situation surrounding the Health for All (HfA) organization and the detained staff in Iguwafe. The stakeholders range from local to international entities, each playing a distinct role in the unfolding scenario. The aim is to clearly visualize these actors, their positions relative to change (whether they seek transformative outcomes or lean towards conservative, status quo approaches), and their spheres of influence (from local to global scale). Given the complex interplay of interests, a stakeholder map will offer insight into potential negotiation paths and relationships that may influence the resolution of the crisis.

Here's the Python `matplotlib` script for plotting the stakeholder map:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Identify and plot stakeholders based on provided details
# Counter Party: Local tribesmen detaining HfA staff
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Local Tribesmen (Counter Party)')  

# Other stakeholders:
# HfA - inclined towards transformative action due to its mission shift and need to relocate resources
x_hfa = -7  
y_hfa = 8  
ax.plot(x_hfa, y_hfa, 'go', label='Health for All')  

# Tribal Leaders - somewhat conservative, seeking to maintain local healthcare
x_tribal_leaders = 2  
y_tribal_leaders = 3  
ax.plot(x_tribal_leaders, y_tribal_leaders, 'bo', label='Tribal Leaders')  

# Government of Beta - far from the negotiation's transformative objectives, conservative
x_gov_beta = 8
y_gov_beta = 2
ax.plot(x_gov_beta, y_gov_beta, 'bo', label='Government of Beta')  

# UN Humanitarian Coordinator - supportive, global influence, seeking solutions
x_un = -5
y_un = 7
ax.plot(x_un, y_un, 'bo', label='UN Coordinator')  

# Main Donors (Germany and Switzerland) - push for relocation, global scale, transformative
x_donors = -8
y_donors = 9
ax.plot(x_donors, y_donors, 'bo', label='Main Donors')

# Local Hospital Staff - local, somewhat conservative, needing operations to continue
x_hospital_staff = 1
y_hospital_staff = -2
ax.plot(x_hospital_staff, y_hospital_staff, 'bo', label='Local Hospital Staff')

# Patients and their families - local, needing transformative changes for healthcare access
x_patients = -3
y_patients = -1
ax.plot(x_patients, y_patients, 'bo', label='Patients/Families')

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Adding labels to the points
stakeholders = ['Local Tribesmen (Counter Party)', 'Health for All', 'Tribal Leaders', 'Government of Beta', 'UN Coordinator', 'Main Donors', 'Local Hospital Staff', 'Patients/Families']
coords = [(0, 0), (x_hfa, y_hfa), (x_tribal_leaders, y_tribal_leaders), (x_gov_beta, y_gov_beta), (x_un, y_un), (x_donors, y_donors), (x_hospital_staff, y_hospital_staff), (x_patients, y_patients)]

for i, txt in enumerate(stakeholders):
    ax.annotate(txt, coords[i], textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Show the plot
output_file_path = os.path.join('gpt_responses/plots', f'plot{np.random.randint(0, 10000)}.png')
plt.savefig(output_file_path)
```

This script visualizes the negotiated stance and influence range of each stakeholder in relation to HfA's crisis in Iguwafe. The mapping articulates the counterparty (local tribesmen) at the origin, reflecting their opposition to the protagonist's (HfA) agenda. The varying distances from the origin across two dimensions (transformational-conservative and local-global) illuminate potential negotiation pathways and leverage points. Stakeholder positioning suggests paths towards resolution that encompass addressing local healthcare needs, navigating the demands of global donors, and engaging with both governmental and tribal authorities.
