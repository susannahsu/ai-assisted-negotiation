This Python script represents the stakeholder map for the situation involving Food Without Borders (FWB) and its planned food aid distribution in a refugee camp, detailing the negotiation landscape with local camp authorities and other entities. Each stakeholder's position on the map considers their inclination towards change (transformative to conservative) and their influence (local to global). Such visualization assists in identifying potential allies and opponents in negotiation, enabling FWB to formulate a more effective strategy.
