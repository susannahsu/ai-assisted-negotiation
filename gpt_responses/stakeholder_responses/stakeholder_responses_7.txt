This script generates a stakeholder map for the negotiation context involving FWB and camp authorities. It visualizes the positions of various stakeholders based on their inclination towards change (transformative to conservative) and their scale of influence (local to global). Additional stakeholders such as UN Humanitarian Coordinator, Health for All, MASHA, and others have been plotted based on the extracted details from the documents provided. The camp authorities, being the counterparty, are centrally placed at the origin in red, symbolizing their pivotal role in the negotiations. Ensure to adjust stakeholders' positions as per the negotiation's evolving dynamics and feedback for accuracy.
