This script plots a stakeholder map based on the provided situation involving Food Without Borders (FWB) and their negotiations within a refugee camp. The camp authorities are positioned at the origin, reflecting their central role in negotiations as the counterparty. FWB is plotted with a significant inclination towards transformative objectives and holds a global influence, marked in green. Additional stakeholders, including the UN, local NGOs like MASHA and Health for All, the local Mayor, Minister of Defense, refugee leaders, militia leaders, local church activists, and the press are also positioned based on their identified objectives and levels of influence.
