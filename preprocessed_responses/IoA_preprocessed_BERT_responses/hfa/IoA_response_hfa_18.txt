- disagreements on the approach towards handling the measles outbreak and other healthcare needs in the absence of hfa.

 recommendations

 prioritize:
- open and transparent communication with all stakeholders, particularly tribal leaders and local healthcare representatives, to clarify intentions and plans.
- exploration of compromises that could allow hfa to fulfill its imminent obligations in ukraine while still supporting local healthcare needs, possibly through phased withdrawal or partnership with other ngos.
- formulating a concrete plan for transitioning healthcare services to local authorities or other ngos, ensuring it includes support for the immediate healthcare crises, like the measles outbreak.
- addressing the safety and compensation concerns of the local guards and their families as a priority, which could facilitate goodwill and cooperation from the tribal leaders.

 avoid:
- unilateral decisions or actions that may exacerbate tensions or misunderstandings with local communities and stakeholders.
- downplaying the importance of local norms, expectations, and understanding of the situation, thereby alienating potential allies in the negotiation.
- ignoring the broader impacts of hfa’s departure on the local healthcare system, which could harm hfa’s reputation and operational capacity in similar contexts globally.
- dismissing the opportunities for collaborative solutions with local leaders, other ngos, and the government, which could mitigate the negative consequences of hfa’s withdrawal.
