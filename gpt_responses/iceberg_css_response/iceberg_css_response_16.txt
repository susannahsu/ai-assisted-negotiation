Based on the provided background and other information, we summarize the negotiation landscape between Food Without Borders (FWB) and the camp authorities in Alpha. This analysis considers three critical aspects of the negotiation outlined below.

### 1. Hiring of Local Guards for Food Distribution

**Counterparty: Camp Authorities**
- **Positions (What):** Insist that FWB hires local guards to assist in the food ration distribution process and compensates them with food rations.
- **Reasoning (How):** Believe that the guards play a crucial role in maintaining security and order during food distribution, which justifies their compensation in food rations. Argue that guards' families also suffer from food insecurity.
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Motivated by the need to sustain the militia by providing for their families and maintaining control over the camp population. Value loyalty and support among militia members and their families.

**User’s Organization: FWB**
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Committed to impartial and neutral provision of food aid, ensuring it reaches those most in need without diversion.
- **Reasoning (How):** Hiring local guards affiliated with militias contravenes FWB's neutrality and could lead to aid diversion. Concerned about the risk of empowering individuals potentially exploiting the refugee population.
- **Positions (What):** Refuses to hire guards or compensate them with food rations due to principles of neutrality and concerns over aid diversion.

### 2. Conducting a Nutritional Assessment

**Counterparty: Camp Authorities**
- **Positions (What):** Deem existing nutritional status data collected by the camp administration as sufficient and urge FWB to expedite food distribution.
- **Reasoning (How):** Prioritize swift assistance to alleviate immediate pressure on refugee families and possibly to fulfill militia's interests by securing food supplies.
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Aim to maintain control over the camp and possibly prevent external scrutiny that might expose vulnerabilities or mismanagement.

**User’s Organization: FWB**
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Committed to effective and targeted aid delivery, ensuring assistance reaches those in genuine need.
- **Reasoning (How):** Believes a thorough, independent nutritional assessment is essential to identify the most vulnerable refugees and avoid misuse of aid.
- **Positions (What):** Insists on conducting a comprehensive nutritional assessment before initiating food distribution.

### 3. Compensation for Workers in the Camp

**Counterparty: Camp Authorities**
- **Positions (What):** Suggest that local guards and possibly other workers should be compensated with food rations instead of cash.
- **Reasoning (How):** Argue that due to exorbitant local market prices and scarcity of goods, food rations are the most practical means of compensation. This also indirectly benefits the militia by ensuring their families receive food aid.
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Driven by the practicality of local economic conditions and the self-interest of sustaining militia members and their families.

**User’s Organization: FWB**
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Seeks to adhere to donor agreements and its own principles which dictate that all food should benefit refugees directly.
- **Reasoning (How):** Concerned that compensating workers with food rations could lead to aid diversion and undermine the effectiveness of the aid program.
- **Positions (What):** Prefers to compensate employees and daily laborers in cash to prevent the diversion of food assistance and maintain aid integrity.

This overview elucidates the divergent positions and underlying motivations of both parties, providing a foundation for FWB to form a negotiation strategy that respects its mission while engaging with the complex realities of operating within the refugee camp in Alpha.
