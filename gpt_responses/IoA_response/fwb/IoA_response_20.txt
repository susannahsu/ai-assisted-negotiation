Island of Agreement (IoA) table for FWB's negotiation with camp authorities:

### Contested Facts:
- The necessity of conducting a new nutritional assessment versus using existing data.
- The efficiency and appropriateness of hiring local guards for food ration distribution.
- The claim that local guards and their families are also in dire need of food assistance, contrasting with FWB’s policy against in-kind food payments.
- The assertion by camp authorities that all workers in the camp must be local guards, while FWB insists on neutrality and independence by refusing to hire militia-affiliated guards.

### Agreed Facts:
- Over 160,000 displaced individuals are in need of urgent food assistance.
- A majority of newcomers are children and women facing severe nutritional deficiencies.
- Sanitary and hygiene conditions within the camps are dire.
- Both parties recognize the importance of a clear distribution plan for relief assistance to reach refugees effectively.

### Convergent Norms:
- The fundamental need for emergency food aid for the refugee population.
- The recognition by both FWB and camp authorities that the situation demands swift action to alleviate pressure on refugee families.
- An underlying agreement on the importance of security during food distribution, albeit differing views on its execution.

### Divergent Norms:
- FWB’s principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence contrast with the camp authorities’ demands for using local guards for security and logistics during the distribution.
- FWB’s policy against in-kind payment (food rations) for services in light of concerns over diversions versus the camp authorities' insistence on food ration payments.
- The disagreement on the freedom of movement for FWB staff within the camp without guard presence.

### Recommendations:

#### Prioritize:
- Establishing a compromise on conducting a nutritional assessment that satisfies both FWB’s donor requirements and the Camp Commander’s need for expedited aid distribution.
- Finding alternative solutions for labor recruitment that adhere to FWB’s principles while addressing the camp authorities' security concerns.
- Negotiating a monitored method for compensating local workers that minimizes the risk of food aid diversion, potentially through a third-party overseer or voucher system.
- Leveraging international advocacy to exert pressure on camp authorities for more flexible operation terms, utilizing media, and diplomatic channels.

#### Avoid:
- Giving in to the demand to exclusively hire local guards, which could compromise FWB’s neutrality and independence.
- Ignoring the potential risks of food aid diversion, which would undermine the mission’s integrity and effectiveness.
- Delaying the distribution of food aid, as the humanitarian crisis requires urgent action.
- Underestimating the camp authorities’ leverage due to their control over the camp and potential influence from local militia.
