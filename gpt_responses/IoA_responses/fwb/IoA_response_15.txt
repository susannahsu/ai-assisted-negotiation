Based on the detailed background and information provided, the following Island of Agreement (IoA) table can be constructed:

**Contested Facts:**
- The necessity and logistics of hiring local guards for food ration distribution.
- The legitimacy and accuracy of the camp population's nutritional status data provided by the camp authorities.
- The feasibility and appropriateness of food rations as a form of compensation for guards.
- The effectiveness and impartiality of FWB's vetting process for potential hires.

**Agreed Facts:**
- Over 160,000 refugees are present in the primary camp, facing severe nutritional deficiencies and inadequate living conditions.
- Both FWB and camp authorities recognize the urgent need for food assistance.
- The local economy and welfare of guards’ families largely depend on the food ration compensation.
- Both parties acknowledge the risk of food aid diversion and the existence of violence and extortion within the camp.

**Convergent Norms:**
- Both parties share a concern for the well-being of the refugee population, particularly the vulnerable groups such as women and children.
- There is a mutual understanding of the necessity for security within the camp during food distribution.
- Both FWB and camp authorities agree on the importance of having a clear and effective distribution plan.

**Divergent Norms:**
- FWB insists on adherence to principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence, opposing the hiring of local guards involved in the conflict.
- The camp authorities and militia demand that local guards are employed and compensated with food rations, citing their families' food insecurity.
- FWB demands freedom of movement within the camp for its staff and a vetting process for hires, which is opposed by the camp authorities.
- The differing views on the legal status of refugees and their rights between Alpha government and international norms advocated by FWB.

**Recommendations:**

**Prioritize:**
- Establishing an independent verification process for the nutritional status of refugees, potentially involving neutral third parties to satisfy both FWB and camp authority concerns.
- Exploring alternative security arrangements that both respect FWB’s principles and address the camp authorities’ security concerns, perhaps through international or neutral local entities.
- Negotiating a compromise on the composition of the workforce for food distribution, potentially incorporating local civilians not affiliated with the guards or militia, under FWB's vetting.
- Implementing transparency measures and conditional agreements to monitor and limit the risk of food aid diversion, including tracking and reporting mechanisms agreeable to both parties.

**Avoid:**
- Any direct financial or in-kind support to the local militia through the employment and compensation of guards, which contradicts FWB's neutrality and could exacerbate the conflict.
- Overlooking the potential risks and drawbacks of employing guards for food distribution, such as increased control over the refugee population and diversion of aid.
- Dismissing the concerns and demands of the refugee leaders regarding the treatment and behavior of local guards and militias.
- Rushing into agreements without thorough consideration of the implications for FWB’s principles, the welfare of the refugee population, and the operational effectiveness of the food aid distribution.
