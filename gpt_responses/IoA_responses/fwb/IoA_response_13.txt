**Island of Agreement (IoA) Table**

- **Contested Facts:**
  1. Accuracy and sufficiency of the camp's existing data on population nutritional status.
  2. FWB's proposed need to conduct a nutritional assessment.
  3. Necessity and appropriateness of employing local guards for the distribution process.
  4. Compensation for the guards through food rations as opposed to FWB’s policy of cash payment.

- **Agreed Facts:**
  1. Over 160,000 refugees are present in the camp facing critical food shortages and nutritional deficiencies.
  2. The camp oversees continual new arrivals, primarily children and women.
  3. Sanitary conditions within the camp are dire with limited healthcare services.
  4. Both FWB and camp authorities recognize the urgent need for food ration distribution.

- **Convergent Norms:**
  1. The overarching objective of alleviating the humanitarian crisis faced by the refugee population.
  2. Acknowledgment from both parties that education about and distribution of food aid are essential to combat the current situation.
  3. Importance of maintaining security within the camp during the food distribution process.

- **Divergent Norms:**
  1. FWB’s insistence on operational independence and neutrality vs. camp authorities’ demand for the employment of local guards in the distribution process.
  2. Disagreement on the compensation structure for the distribution process participants (cash vs. food rations).
  3. FWB's policy against employing individuals directly involved in the conflict vs. the camp authority's requirement to employ local guards.

**Recommendations for Negotiation Strategy:**

- **Prioritize:**
  1. Establishing a shared understanding of the urgent humanitarian needs and the mutual goal of effective food distribution.
  2. Negotiating the possibility of FWB conducting a transparent and swift nutritional assessment with minimal interference, to address the German government’s stipulations and ensure aid reaches those in dire need.
  3. Exploring alternative security arrangements that satisfy camp security concerns without compromising FWB's neutrality, such as international or neutral local observers during distribution.
  4. Creating a detailed, joint distribution plan that specifies roles, responsibilities, and oversight mechanisms to prevent aid diversion.
  5. Discussing non-food compensation alternatives for guards/local workers that do not contravene FWB policies but are acceptable to the camp authorities and practical within the local context.

- **Avoid:**
  1. Compromising FWB’s core principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.
  2. Employment of local guards directly involved in the conflict that may exacerbate the mistrust among the refugees towards the distribution process.
  3. Entering into an agreement that allows for the potential diversion of aid, undermining the mission to assist the refugees effectively.
  4. Ignoring the insights and grievances of the refugee leaders and local NGOs about the impacts of the militia's control over the camps.
