 user’s organization: health for all (hfa)

- positions (what): hfa is open to negotiating terms for a transitional plan that ensures the continuity of essential health services until a suitable replacement is found, including measures against the measles outbreak.

aspect [NUMBER]: financial and operational constraints

- motives and values (why): hfa operates within the confines of its financial resources and donor directives, aiming for the most effective use of its limited funding in alignment with its mission to serve those affected by crises.
- reasoning (how): the operational shift to ukraine is dictated not by a disregard for the needs of the iguwafe community but by the necessity to address more urgent conflicts as determined by donor priorities.
- positions (what): although committed to finding a resolution for the immediate crisis in iguwafe, hfa's position is that maintaining long-term operations there is not feasible under the current financial constraints and strategic directives.

utilizing this structured analysis, the hfa negotiation team can approach discussions with the tribesmen and other stakeholders more strategically, aiming for a resolution that considers both the immediate crisis and the long-term healthcare needs of the iguwafe community.
