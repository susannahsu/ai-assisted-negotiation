### Island of Agreement (IoA) Table

**Contested Facts:**
- HfA's decision to close trauma operations in Beta with limited local consultation.
- The misconception that detained staff are hostages rather than being treated as guests according to local traditions.
- The true intention behind HfA's rapid operational shift to Ukraine without discussing viable transition plans for the local hospital.
- The capacity and willingness of local health authorities to take over HfA's operations amid the measles outbreak.
- Claims and perspectives regarding HfA's contributions and responsibilities towards the local guards and their families.

**Agreed Facts:**
- HfA played a crucial role in providing surgical and healthcare services amidst the ethnic clashes in Beta.
- There is an immediate need for healthcare services in Iguwafe, including surgeries and combating the measles outbreak.
- International organizations, including HfA, significantly support the healthcare infrastructure in conflict or post-conflict regions like Beta.
- The government of Beta and tribal leaders have limited resources and capabilities to fill the void left by HfA's departure.
- The detained HfA staff's well-being and security are a priority for both HfA and the tribal leaders.


**Convergent Norms:**
- Ensuring the safety and security of healthcare workers operating in conflict or post-conflict zones.
- The moral obligation to provide healthcare to vulnerable populations, especially in regions with limited access to medical services.
- Recognition of the sacrifices made by local guards and the importance of addressing their families' needs.
- The importance of engaging with local stakeholders, including tribal leaders and the patient community, to ensure sustainable healthcare delivery.
- Upholding the principle of medical neutrality and ensuring healthcare initiatives are not politicized.


**Divergent Norms:**
- HfA’s policy of not negotiating under threats or paying ransoms versus tribal leaders' demands for specific commitments before releasing staff.
- The perception of HfA's departure as a form of humanitarian colonialism versus HfA’s operational priorities dictated by donor constraints and global demands.
- The role and influence of tribal leaders in healthcare management and labor disputes within the healthcare sector.
- Prioritization of humanitarian aid – immediate conflict-related crises versus sustainable development in healthcare infrastructure.


### Recommendations

**Prioritize:**
- Engaging in direct, respectful dialogue with tribal leaders and local stakeholders to address the immediate crisis and negotiate the release of detained staff.
- Committing to short-term medical support to address the measles outbreak and emergency surgical needs as a gesture of goodwill and shared responsibility.
- Exploring partnerships with local NGOs, government health agencies, or international organizations to ensure continuity of care post-HfA departure.
- Transparent communication regarding HfA's operational constraints and seeking mutual understanding with the local community and donors about realistic transition plans.

**Avoid:**
- Further actions that could be perceived as disrespectful or undermining the authority of tribal leaders and local customs.
- Making commitments HfA cannot fulfill given the donor constraints and strategic focus on Ukraine, which could exacerbate trust issues.
- Neglecting the concerns and needs of the local guards’ families and the broader patient community, as it could lead to deeper resentment and complications.
- Allowing the negotiation to be solely about the detainment situation without addressing the underlying healthcare service void and community needs.
