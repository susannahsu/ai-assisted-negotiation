Based on the comprehensive situation described, here is the detailed Island of Agreement (IoA) analysis for the negotiation concerning Health for All's (HfA) operations in Iguwafe and the safe release of their detained staff:

### Contested Facts:
- **The irreversibility of HfA’s departure:** Tribesmen and local stakeholders contest this. HfA plans to redirect resources to conflict-stricken Ukraine, but the local community demands continued operations or at least a transition plan.
- **Compensation for local guards:** The local community insists on compensations for the hospital's guards, some of whom faced death or debilitating injuries.
- **Operational Needs vs. Beneficiary Requirements:** HfA focuses on reallocating to areas with immediate surgical requirements due to war (Ukraine), while local needs shift towards other types of medical surgeries and measles outbreaks.
  
### Agreed Facts:
- **Critical role of HfA in Iguwafe's healthcare:** Both parties acknowledge HfA's significant impact on local healthcare, particularly surgical operations.
- **Increased need for healthcare services:** Recognition that with the subsidence of conflicts, the demand has shifted towards care for injuries from other sources and the necessity for measles vaccination.
- **Security threat to HfA staff:** It is acknowledged that the staff are detained under threat, which is unacceptable and requires resolution.

### Convergent Norms:
- **Importance of healthcare access:** Both parties value healthcare access for the local population, understanding the gap that HfA’s departure might leave.
- **Safety and security of HfA staff:** The health and well-being of the detained staff are a priority.
- **Role of tribal leadership in mediating local issues:** The influential role of tribal leaders as mediators and protectors of communal interests is recognized.

### Divergent Norms:
- **Resource allocation and priorities:** HfA prioritizes global crises based on donor directions, while local stakeholders prioritize the continuous and immediate healthcare needs of Iguwafe.
- **Negotiation with hostile parties:** How to negotiate with the tribesmen detaining HfA staff (negotiation without ransom vs. the tribesmen’s demands for HfA’s continued operation or compensation).
  
### Recommendations:

#### Prioritize:
- **Ensuring staff safety:** Immediate release of the detained staff through assurance of continuing critical healthcare services temporarily while transition plans are developed.
- **Open and transparent communication:** Establishing direct, respectful dialogue with tribal and local leaders to avoid misunderstandings and build trust.
- **Seeking a transition plan:** Exploring possibilities for local health authorities or other NGOs to take over HfA's operations with adequate training and resources provision to ensure sustainability.
- **Addressing critical healthcare needs:** Immediate efforts to contain the measles outbreak and ensure access to essential surgeries for the affected populations.

#### Avoid:
- **Abrupt withdrawal:** Making sudden decisions without local stakeholder engagement and without establishing a viable transition plan.
- **Neglecting local norms and governance structures:** Ignoring the significance of tribal leaders and local guards in maintaining security and order.
- **Undermining staff and patient safety:** Compromising on safety measures for detained staff or patients in need of medical care.
  
### Conclusion:
The negotiation strategy should focus on acknowledging tribal leaders' influence, openly discussing contested facts, relying on agreed facts as the basis for trust-building, and addressing divergent norms through a shared commitment to healthcare access and community well-being. Constructive engagement, prioritizing healthcare service continuity, and exploring sustainable transition plans are essential steps towards resolving the standoff and ensuring the safety of HfA staff.
