### Island of Agreement (IoA) Table

#### Contested Facts:
- Efficacy and necessity of a new technical assessment for nutritional status.
- Adequacy of existing data on refugee population nutritional and health status.
- FWB's ability to hire non-guard labor for food distribution.
- The nature and extent of food insecurity among camp guards and their families.
- The potential for food aid diversion by the local guards.

#### Agreed Facts:
- Over 160,000 forcibly displaced refugees are housed in the primary camp.
- Refugees are facing severe nutritional deficiencies, inadequate shelter, and access to clean water.
- The local guards are affiliated with armed militias.
- Both parties acknowledge the urgent need for food assistance among the refugee population.
- FWB and camp authorities recognize the complications and tensions surrounding the payment and utilization of guards in the distribution process.

#### Convergent Norms:
- The primary objective of alleviating suffering and supporting the well-being and dignity of refugees.
- Recognition that both the refugee population and the guards (to some extent) are affected by the broader crisis.
- Acknowledgment of the threat posed by diversion of food aid and its impact on the effectiveness of assistance.

#### Divergent Norms:
- FWB’s policies on neutrality, impartiality, and independence versus the Camp Commander’s insistence on employing guards for security and distribution roles.
- Communal versus individualistic approaches to food aid distribution.
- Definitions of beneficiaries: FWB focusing on refugees versus Camp Commander and militia leaders focusing on guards/families as well.

### Recommendations

#### Prioritize:
- Reiterating the necessity and humanitarian imperative for an updated technical nutritional assessment as per donor stipulations for targeted food aid distribution.
- Establishing a mutually agreed framework for ensuring food aid reaches its intended recipients without diversion, possibly involving third-party monitoring.
- Exploring hybrid solutions for incorporating local guards in logistical aspects without compromising FWB's neutrality or enabling food diversion, e.g., employing third-party local community members under FWB oversight for food distribution while offering non-food compensations to the guards for security roles.

#### Avoid:
- Directly challenging or accusing the camp authorities of complicity in food diversion in public or contentious settings to maintain a cooperative stance for negotiations.
- Accepting uncompromisable demands from the camp authorities that violate FWB’s core principles or the terms stipulated by its donors.
- Overlooking the necessity of updating food distribution lists through a comprehensive assessment, which could lead to ineffective aid delivery and potential donor repercussions.
