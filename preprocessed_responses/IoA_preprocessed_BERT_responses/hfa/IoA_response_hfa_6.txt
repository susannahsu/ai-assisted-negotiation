based on the comprehensive background provided and the meetings with various stakeholders, the following island of agreement (ioa) table can be constructed:

contested facts:
- hfa's abrupt decision to leave iguwafe and its consequences on local healthcare and security.
- the stance that detained hfa staff are hostages versus guests/under house arrest.
- the legitimacy of the demands from tribal leaders and the local community for hfa to continue operations in iguwafe.
- the effectiveness and morality of ceasing operations in beta to reallocate resources to ukraine.
- the responsibility of hfa for compensating the guards' families.

agreed facts:
- hfa has played a crucial role in providing surgical and medical care in iguwafe, especially during and after the ethnic clashes.
- the local healthcare infrastructure is insufficient without international ngos' support.
- the abrupt departure of hfa's country director and the limited local consultation have escalated tensions.
- measles cases are on the rise in the region.
- there is a global pressure on ngos like hfa to shift resources to areas deemed in more urgent need, like ukraine.
- the local government and tribal leaders have historically played a significant role in security and order in iguwafe.

convergent norms:
- the safety and well-being of hfa staff and local population are paramount.
- healthcare provision in conflict or post-conflict zones is critical and should continue.
- acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by local guards and their families.
- the importance of continued dialogue and negotiation to resolve the current crisis.

divergent norms:
- perception of hfa's responsibility towards the local healthcare system and its sustainability post-departure.
- the role of international ngos in development versus emergency response in stable versus conflict zones.
- appropriate forms of compensation and support for local guards and their families.
- the role and authority of tribal leaders in healthcare and labor disputes.

recommendations:

- prioritize:
  - establishing a clear, respectful communication channel with tribal leaders to negotiate the safe release of detained staff.
  - negotiating a transition plan that includes short-term continuation of critical healthcare services, particularly related to measles outbreak and emergency surgeries.
  - exploring partnerships with organizations like swisscross for specialized services (e.g., plastic surgery) that hfa cannot provide.
  - addressing the immediate healthcare needs highlighted by community representatives, offering a compromise towards a phased withdrawal or reduction in service rather than abrupt cessation.
  - seeking support from entities like fwb to leverage their connections and local rapport.

- avoid:
  - any actions that could be perceived as disrespecting local norms or bypassing the authority of tribal leaders.
  - making promises that cannot be realistically fulfilled given the financial and operational constraints facing hfa.
  - ignoring the grievances and demands of the local community, including those of the guards' families and the patient association.
  - public confrontations or statements that could escalate tensions further or compromise the safety of detained staff.
  - assuming that financial incentives or compensations alone will resolve the dispute without addressing the underlying concerns about healthcare continuity and community trust.
