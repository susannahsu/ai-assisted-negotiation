This script visualizes the stakeholder map for FWBâ€™s negotiations with camp authorities, including various parties' positions relative to their objectives and influences. Each stakeholder is plotted to reflect their inclined towards transformative or conservative approaches and their local to global influence extent. The Camp Authorities, being the counterparty to FWB, are placed at the origin to signify their central role in the negotiation.
