Based on the detailed case information provided and the subsequent meetings and statements from involved parties, the Island of Agreement (IoA) table can be populated as follows:

- **Contested Facts:**
  1. HfA's abrupt decision to leave vs. the requirement to divert resources to Ukraine.
  2. The safety and status of the detained HfA staff (hostages vs. guests).
  3. The completion or continuation of HfA operations in Iguwafe (surgical and measles outbreak interventions).
  4. Compensation demands for the hospital guards' families.
  5. Funding and operational constraints faced by HfA.

- **Agreed Facts:**
  1. HfA has played a critical role in providing surgical and healthcare services in Iguwafe, especially during and post-conflict.
  2. There is a substantial healthcare need in Iguwafe, with current concerns about measles outbreaks.
  3. Tribal leaders and the local population hold significant influence over the security and operational capability of NGOs like HfA.
  4. The departure of HfA’s surgical team and broader operations will significantly impact the local healthcare infrastructure and capacity.

- **Convergent Norms:**
  1. The importance of ensuring the safety and well-being of the detained HfA staff.
  2. Recognition of the local guards' sacrifices and the hardship faced by their families.
  3. The shared goal of maintaining essential healthcare services in Iguwafe, including surgical care and addressing the measles outbreak.

- **Divergent Norms:**
  1. The approach to resolving the current crisis (Immediate HfA departure vs. continued operation or a phased transition).
  2. The responsibilities of HfA towards the local guards' families and the broader community in terms of compensation and support.
  3. Perception of HfA’s decisions as a breach of trust versus a strategic redirection of resources driven by donor demands.

### Recommendations:

- **Prioritize:**
  1. Establishing a safe and respectful negotiation channel with tribal leaders to ensure the security and eventual release of detained HfA staff.
  2. Working towards an agreement that allows for a contingency plan for continued healthcare services, possibly involving a phased withdrawal or partnership with other NGOs to take over services.
  3. Addressing the measles outbreak as a top priority, demonstrating HfA’s commitment to the local community's health needs.
  4. Offering a clear, transparent explanation and apology for the sudden decision-making process concerning the departure from Iguwafe, aiming to mend relations with local stakeholders.

- **Avoid:**
  1. Any actions that could be perceived as disrespectful or undermining the authority of tribal leaders.
  2. Ignoring the needs and demands of the local hospital staff, guards, and their families, as their support is crucial for any form of continued healthcare operations.
  3. Dismissing the broader implications of HfA's departure on the local healthcare infrastructure without ensuring that alternative support mechanisms are established.
  4. Making promises or commitments that cannot be fulfilled, as this would further damage trust and hinder negotiation progress.
