- accusations of hfa employing a form of "humanitarian colonialism."
- the nature of the staff's detainment (hostage situation vs. labor dispute).
- the capacity and willingness of hfa to address the measles outbreak and ongoing surgical needs.

agreed facts:
- hfa's surgical operations have been vital to the iguwafe community, especially during conflict periods.
- the situation has escalated to the point where hfa staff is under house arrest.
- there is a pressing need for medical care, including emergency surgeries and measles vaccinations.
- both hfa and tribal leaders recognize the importance of restarting hospital operations quickly.
- the immediate goal is to ensure the safety and release of detained hfa staff.

convergent norms:
- health and safety of the community and hfa staff are priorities.
- compensation and recognition for the guards' families’ sacrifices are acknowledged as important by all parties.
- there is a shared understanding of the importance of international aid in iguwafe, particularly in healthcare.
- a need for continuity in healthcare services, even if hfa must transition out of the district. 

divergent norms:
- hfa believes its mission is primarily in conflict zones and expects to redirect resources to ukraine, considering the decreasing violence in iguwafe.
- tribal leaders and the local community view hfa's departure as premature and potentially catastrophic for local healthcare, interpreting it as neglect.
- the role and influence of international donors in determining hfa's operational priorities, with local needs being sidelined.
- the perception of the ongoing situation, with hfa viewing it as a labor dispute and local actors possibly seeing it as leverage for negotiation or ransom.

recommendations:

prioritize:
- immediate safety and securing the release of hfa staff with verbal assurances to engage in meaningful dialogue regarding the continuation of certain critical services.
- establishing a communication channel with tribal leaders, leveraging intermediaries like fwb with established local rapport.
- identifying a transition plan that could involve local health personnel training and seeking an interim ngo to take over the surgical and immunization operations.
- offering a concrete, albeit temporary, healthcare plan to manage the measles outbreak and urgent surgeries, showing goodwill.
- exploring funding or assistance specifically aimed at compensating the guards’ families in collaboration with local authorities.

avoid:
- entering into commitments that hfa cannot fulfill long-term, creating false expectations.
- public confrontations or communications that could escalate tensions or undermine tribal authority.
- dismissing the cultural and social dynamics at play, particularly the role and expectations of tribal leaders and the local community.
- overlooking the advice and warnings from the un security coordinator regarding the potential danger posed by local guards and affiliated tribesmen.

this structured approach to the negotiation acknowledges the complex interplay of humanitarian needs, tribal dynamics, the expectations of international donors, and the urgent requirement to ensure the safety of hfa staff in a challenging environment.
