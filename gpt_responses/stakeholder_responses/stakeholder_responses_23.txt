This Python script visualizes the stakeholder map for the FWB negotiation situation in Alpha. The stakeholders have been positioned based on their inclination towards transformation (left to right) and their local to global influence (bottom to top). The protagonist, FWB, is plotted with higher global influence and a position towards transformation, reflecting their intention to change the current state for the better. The counterparty, the Camp Authorities, is at the origin, indicating their central opposition role in this negotiation.

Please ensure to have a unique identifier for the plot name when saving it. This will help in proper filing and retrieval of the stakeholder map for analysis and future reference.

Would you like to make any adjustments to the stakeholders' positions or add more details?
