island of agreement (ioa) table for fwb's negotiation with camp authorities:

 contested facts:
- the necessity of conducting a new nutritional assessment versus using existing data.
- the efficiency and appropriateness of hiring local guards for food ration distribution.
- the claim that local guards and their families are also in dire need of food assistance, contrasting with fwb’s policy against in-kind food payments.
- the assertion by camp authorities that all workers in the camp must be local guards, while fwb insists on neutrality and independence by refusing to hire militia-affiliated guards.

 agreed facts:
- over [NUMBER],[NUMBER] displaced individuals are in need of urgent food assistance.
- a majority of newcomers are children and women facing severe nutritional deficiencies.
- sanitary and hygiene conditions within the camps are dire.
- both parties recognize the importance of a clear distribution plan for relief assistance to reach refugees effectively.

 convergent norms:
- the fundamental need for emergency food aid for the refugee population.
- the recognition by both fwb and camp authorities that the situation demands swift action to alleviate pressure on refugee families.
- an underlying agreement on the importance of security during food distribution, albeit differing views on its execution.

 divergent norms:
- fwb’s principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence contrast with the camp authorities’ demands for using local guards for security and logistics during the distribution.
- fwb’s policy against in-kind payment (food rations) for services in light of concerns over diversions versus the camp authorities' insistence on food ration payments.
- the disagreement on the freedom of movement for fwb staff within the camp without guard presence.

 recommendations:

 prioritize:
- establishing a compromise on conducting a nutritional assessment that satisfies both fwb’s donor requirements and the camp commander’s need for expedited aid distribution.
- finding alternative solutions for labor recruitment that adhere to fwb’s principles while addressing the camp authorities' security concerns.
- negotiating a monitored method for compensating local workers that minimizes the risk of food aid diversion, potentially through a third-party overseer or voucher system.
- leveraging international advocacy to exert pressure on camp authorities for more flexible operation terms, utilizing media, and diplomatic channels.

 avoid:
- giving in to the demand to exclusively hire local guards, which could compromise fwb’s neutrality and independence.
- ignoring the potential risks of food aid diversion, which would undermine the mission’s integrity and effectiveness.
- delaying the distribution of food aid, as the humanitarian crisis requires urgent action.
- underestimating the camp authorities’ leverage due to their control over the camp and potential influence from local militia.
