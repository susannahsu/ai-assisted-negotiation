Based on the provided information, the Island of Agreement (IoA) analysis for the negotiation between Health for All (HfA) and Tribal Leaders in Iguwafe, along with other stakeholders involved, can be structured as follows:

**Contested Facts:**
- The necessity and urgency of HfA's redeployment from Iguwafe to Ukraine.
- Responsibilities of HfA towards local guards and their families.
- The actual safety and freedom of the detained HfA staff.
- HfA's capacity and obligation to support the ongoing healthcare needs in Iguwafe, including measles outbreak response and surgical care continuation.
- The perceived intentions behind HfA's actions and their impact on the local community.

**Agreed Facts:**
- The critical role HfA has played in the district's healthcare, especially during conflict and in the aftermath for trauma patients.
- The importance of the surgical unit to the local population’s healthcare needs.
- Rising measles cases and the necessity for immediate healthcare interventions.
- The genuine need for healthcare services continuation despite HfA’s strategic shift.
- The local healthcare infrastructure's inadequacy to handle current healthcare demands without HfA.
  
**Convergent Norms:**
- Ensuring the safety and well-being of HfA international staff.
- Recognition of the healthcare services HfA provided as vital to the community.
- Acknowledgment of the valuable contributions of local guards during HfA's operation period.
- The principle of providing necessary healthcare services to vulnerable populations.
- Agreement on the need to support children requiring reconstructive surgeries and vaccination efforts against measles.

**Divergent Norms:**
- The appropriate response and extent of HfA's commitment to Iguwafe post-redeployment (Continuation vs. total cessation of services).
- Compensation and support for families of deceased or disabled local guards.
- Redistribution of resources and priorities between global crises (e.g., Ukraine vs. Beta).
- The role and involvement of tribal leaders in healthcare operations and labor disputes.

**Recommendation for Negotiation Strategy:**

**Prioritize:**
- Ensuring the safety and release of the detained HfA staff as a non-negotiable priority.
- Establishing a short-term plan for the continuation of critical healthcare services, especially emergency surgeries and measles vaccinations.
- Communicating a clear, realistic commitment regarding HfA’s future in Iguwafe to avoid misunderstandings.
- Collaborating with local stakeholders, including tribal leaders, government officials, and other NGOs, for a sustainable healthcare transition strategy.
- Offering a concrete support plan for the families of the local guards, possibly through a one-time assistance fund, to acknowledge their sacrifices and importance.

**Avoid:**
- Engaging in actions or rhetoric that could be perceived as disrespecting tribal authority or local norms.
- Making vague commitments that HfA cannot fulfill, leading to further distrust.
- Ignoring the broader social implications of HfA’s departure on the local healthcare infrastructure and community trust.
- Underestimating the importance of transparent, inclusive discussions with all relevant stakeholders before making significant decisions.
- Disregarding the significance of restoring and maintaining operational healthcare services in the short term as a gesture of good faith and commitment to patient care.
