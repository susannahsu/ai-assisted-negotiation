recommendations

prioritize:
- ensuring that the refugees' immediate nutritional needs are met by facilitating the delivery of emergency food rations as swiftly as possible.
- finding a compromise on the hiring process that respects fwb's principles while addressing the camp authorities' security concerns, possibly through vetting and training a selected group of local non-militia volunteers for the distribution process.
- introducing a transparent mechanism to monitor food aid distribution, mitigating the risk of diversion. this could involve third-party oversight or more rigorous record-keeping and reporting.
- establishing a clear agreement on the conduct and responsibilities of any local personnel involved in the food distribution, aligning with humanitarian principles.

avoid:
- aggravating tensions with the camp authorities by unilaterally imposing fwb's conditions without any form of negotiation or compromise.
- overlooking the potential security risks to fwb staff, aid supplies, and refugees themselves by insisting on operating without any form of local security presence within the camp.
- dismissing the camp authorities' proposal without first exploring all possible solutions that could allow for some form of local employment that aligns with fwb's principles.
- ignoring the broader political and social context, including the stance of the alpha government and local militia, which could jeopardize not only the negotiation but also the safety and effectiveness of the humanitarian operation.
