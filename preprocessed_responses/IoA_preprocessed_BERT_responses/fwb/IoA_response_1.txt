island of agreement (ioa) table analysis

contested facts:
- the necessity of employing local guards for food distribution.
- the validity and sufficiency of current nutritional status data provided by camp authorities.
- the appropriateness and feasibility of in-kind (food rations) vs. cash payment to workers.
- the assertion by camp authorities that guards' families also face food insecurity and thus deserve aid.
- the claim that many refugees trade their rations for other goods in the camp market.

agreed facts:
- over [NUMBER],[NUMBER] refugees are located in the camp near the national hero roundabout, facing food shortages and health issues.
- fwb's goal is to provide emergency food rations to refugees experiencing food insecurity.
- there's an increase in newly arrived refugees, with women and children facing severe nutritional deficiencies.
- the need for a technical assessment to identify refugees facing food insecurity, although the timeline and methodology are points of contention.
- the camps are controlled by local authorities linked to armed militias, affecting the security and operations within the camp.

convergent norms:
- recognition of the urgent need for food assistance in the refugee camp to prevent further humanitarian crises.
- acknowledgment of security concerns within the camp.
- the importance of a clear and effective distribution plan for food rations.

divergent norms:
- fwb’s insistence on neutrality, impartiality, and independence versus camp authorities’ demand for the involvement of local guards in the distribution process and their compensation with food rations.
- the approach to assessing refugee needs (fwb’s comprehensive nutritional assessment vs. camp authorities’ reliance on existing data).
- fwb's policy against paying workers in food rations due to the risk of diversion, conflicting with camp authorities' and local guards' insistence on food compensation.

recommendations:

prioritize:
- establishing a mutually agreed-upon method for assessing refugee needs that satisfies fwb's requirements for accuracy and impartiality while addressing the camp authorities’ call for swift action.
- exploring alternative security arrangements that allow fwb to maintain its principles of neutrality and independence, perhaps through an independent third party that can provide security without the conflicts associated with hiring local guards.
- identifying non-guard local community members for employment in the food distribution process, potentially through negotiation with the camp authorities, to address concerns about neutrality and aid diversion.
- developing a transparent and secure distribution system that minimizes the risk of food diversion, possibly by incorporating technology or monitoring by independent observers.

avoid:
- empowering camp guards and militia members by involving them directly in the food distribution process, which could lead to further exploitation of the refugees.
- dismissing the need for a comprehensive nutritional assessment, as this could undermine the effectiveness and targeted nature of fwb's assistance.
- acceding to demands that conflict with fwb’s core principles (e.g., paying workers in food rations), which could compromise the organization's integrity and the effectiveness of its mission.
- delaying the negotiation process or the initiation of food distribution efforts, as the humanitarian situation is urgent and lives are at stake.
