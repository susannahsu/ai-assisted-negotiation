Given the complexity and multitude of stakeholders involved in the situation faced by Health for All (HfA) in Iguwafe, Country Beta, mapping out the negotiation landscape through a stakeholder analysis is crucial. We need to identify and locate each party involved in this negotiation on a stakeholder map to visualize their positions, influence, and relationships systematically. Here's how this map would look, using the standard `matplotlib` script adapted to this scenario:

- **Primary Party (Protagonist)**: Health for All (HfA)
- **Counterparty**: Tribal Leaders in Iguwafe (their interests directly oppose HfA's intention to close operations in Iguwafe and move resources to Ukraine)

Given the detailed situation, stakeholders identified include HfA's Geneva representatives, tribal leaders, local hospital staff, international staff currently under house arrest, local government officials (police chief, local administration head), international entities (UN, German and Swiss ambassadors), local population (including the Patient Association and families of patients), and local guards (including their families).

Here's the Python `matplotlib` code to produce the stakeholder map for the scenario:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 8))

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map of HfA Incident in Iguwafe')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counterparty
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Tribal Leaders')  # 'ro' for red circle

# Define positions of other stakeholders
positions = {
    'HfA Geneva Representatives': (5, 7),
    'Local Hospital Staff': (-3, 2),
    'Detained International Staff': (-1, 1),
    'Local Government Officials': (0, 5),
    'UN Representatives': (4, 8),
    'German Ambassador': (6, 9),
    'Swiss Ambassador': (6, 8),
    'Local Population/Patient Association': (-5, 3),
    'Local Guards and Families': (-4, 4),
    'Head Surgeon of HfA': (-2, 2)
}

# Plot and label the stakeholders
for name, pos in positions.items():
    ax.plot(pos[0], pos[1], 'bo')  # 'bo' for blue circle
    ax.annotate(name, pos, textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Show the plot
output_file_path = os.path.join('gpt_responses/plots', 'hfa_stakeholder_map.png')
plt.savefig(output_file_path)
plt.show()
```

This visualization aids in understanding the dynamic interplay between the various stakeholders involved in the HfA situation in Iguwafe. By positioning these parties according to their objectives (x-axis: from transformative to conservative) and their influence (y-axis: from local to global), we can strategize negotiation paths more effectively. The plot places the primary counterparty, the Tribal Leaders, at the origin, marking them as central to the negotiation process with HfA and other stakeholders positioned around this central conflict, indicating their relative stances and potential influence on the outcome.
