Given the complex scenario involving Health for All (HfA) and its entanglement in Iguwafe with local tribesmen and various stakeholders, let's proceed to systematically define the stakeholder map for this negotiation. This step involves identifying all parties involved, extracting their roles, understanding their relationships, and situating them within the negotiation's context.

### Stakeholders Identification:

1. **Primary Party (Protagonist)**: Health for All (HfA) - An international health organization providing surgical care impacted by negotiations to ensure the safe release of its staff and possibly continue its operations in Beta, particularly in Iguwafe.

2. **Counterparty**: Local Armed Tribesmen - They have detained HfA's international staff, demanding actions from HfA before their release and have positioned themselves directly against HfA's interests.

3. **Other Key Stakeholders**:
   - Tribal Leaders: Mediate tensions and have set demands for HfA.
   - Local Hospital Staff and Community: Dependents on HfA's healthcare services.
   - German and Swiss Donors: Main donors pressuring resource redirection.
   - The Government of Country Beta: A distant yet critical stakeholder in resolving the conflict.
   - International Organizations (e.g., UN, FWB, CPI): Offering varied support and advice.
   - Local Media and Patient Association: Highlighting the community's response and needs.
   - Guards and their Families: Seek compensation and are involved in detaining staff.

### Stakeholder Map Visualization Script:

Considering the outlined scenario, the stakeholder map is defined below. Note, this script will plot an initial mapping, subject to user adjustments for accuracy:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Local Armed Tribesmen')  # 'ro' stands for red dot

# Example coordinates for other stakeholders
stakeholders = {
    'HfA': (5, 4),
    'Tribal Leaders': (2, 3),
    'Local Hospital Staff': (4, 1),
    'German and Swiss Donors': (7, 7),
    'The Government of Country Beta': (3, -3),
    'International Organizations (UN, FWB, CPI)': (6, 5),
    'Local Media and Patient Association': (1, 2),
    'Guards and Families': (2, 1)
}

# Plotting other stakeholders
for label, xy in stakeholders.items():
    ax.plot(xy[0], xy[1], 'bo')  # 'bo' for blue dots
    ax.annotate(label, xy, textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Show the plot
output_file_path = os.path.join('gpt_responses/plots', 'stakeholder_map.png')
plt.savefig(output_file_path)
```

This script marks the initial positions of identified stakeholders on the negotiation landscape, ideal for plotting and visualizing their respective stances and influence levels. Further refinements may be needed based on detailed analyses and feedback.
