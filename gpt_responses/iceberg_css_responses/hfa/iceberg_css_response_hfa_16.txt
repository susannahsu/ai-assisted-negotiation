Given the complex and multifaceted situation involving the Health for All (HfA) organization’s decision to withdraw from Iguwafe in Country Beta to redirect resources to Ukraine, and the subsequent detainment of their international staff by local tribesmen, a structured approach to negotiation using the Iceberg and Common Shared Space (CSS) models can assist in guiding HfA’s negotiation strategy with the local tribal leaders. This structured approach addresses key aspects: the safety of detained staff, continuation of medical aid, and addressing local community's concerns.

### Aspect 1: Safety of Detained International Staff

**Counterparty: Local tribal leaders**

- Positions: Tribal leaders demand a commitment from HfA to continue operations and address community healthcare needs before releasing the staff.
- Reasoning: The immediate demonstration of commitment by HfA is seen as leverage to ensure the community’s immediate healthcare needs are met.
- Motives and Values: Prioritizing community welfare, maintaining authority and control, and ensuring the community does not lose essential healthcare services.

**User’s Organization: Health for All (HfA)**

- Motives and Values: Primarily focused on the safety and well-being of their team, adhering to their principle of not paying ransom, and ensuring their activities do not exacerbate the situation.
- Reasoning: Ensuring the safety of the team is crucial for maintaining operational integrity and public trust in future missions. Engaging in dialogue demonstrates HfA’s willingness to find a humane and ethical solution.
- Positions: Willing to negotiate terms for the safe release of staff but within the confines of HfA’s policies and capabilities.

### Aspect 2: Continuation of Medical Aid

**Counterparty: Local tribal leaders**

- Positions: Demand HfA to either continue providing medical aid or facilitate a seamless transition to local health authorities or other NGOs.
- Reasoning: The provision of continuous medical aid is critical for the community's health and well-being, especially in the wake of rising measles cases.
- Motives and Values: Ensuring the long-term health and resilience of the community, upholding the community's dignity, and preventing further health crises.

**User’s Organization: Health for All (HfA)**

- Motives and Values: Committed to providing healthcare to underserved populations, ensuring the quality and continuity of care, and advocating for health as a human right.
- Reasoning: Understanding that a sudden cessation of medical services would lead to detrimental health outcomes, HfA is motivated to negotiate for a phased transition that ensures patient care continuity.
- Positions: Proposes to negotiate for a managed transition of services to local healthcare providers or other NGOs, with support in training and resources as feasible.

### Aspect 3: Addressing Community and Guard Family Concerns

**Counterparty: Local tribal leaders and community representatives**

- Positions: Compensation for the local guards’ families and addressing the measles outbreak as prerequisites for negotiations.
- Reasoning: Recognizes the sacrifices made by local guards and the immediate threat posed by measles to local children and families.
- Motives and Values: Justice for families who have lost their loved ones, community health and safety, and ensuring negotiable resolutions respect the community’s contributions and losses.

**User’s Organization: Health for All (HfA)**

- Motives and Values: Recognition of the local guards’ contributions, commitment to community health, and ethical responsibility towards those impacted by their operations.
- Reasoning: Addressing these concerns would not only aid in the resolution of the immediate crisis but also leave a lasting positive impact on HfA’s reputation and relationships within the community.
- Positions: Willing to explore sustainable solutions for compensating the guards’ families and assisting in the measles outbreak response, possibly through partnerships with other NGOs and government health departments, ensuring these actions align with HfA’s mission and do not set unsustainable precedents.

By approaching these negotiations with a clear understanding of both parties' positions, reasoning, and underlying motives and values, HfA can navigate towards a solution that respects the needs and dignity of the Iguwafe community while adhering to its organizational principles and capabilities.
