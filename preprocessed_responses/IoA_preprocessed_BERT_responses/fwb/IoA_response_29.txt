based on the comprehensive information provided, here's the island of agreement (ioa) table for the negotiation between food without borders (fwb) and the camp authorities:

contested facts:
- fwb believes a nutritional assessment is necessary for effective aid distribution, whereas the camp commander views existing data as sufficient.
- the camp authorities demand fwb to employ local guards for food distribution, conflicting with fwb's neutrality and independence principles.
- camp authorities propose compensating guards with food rations, which contradicts fwb policies due to concerns over aid diversion.
- the camp commander and local militia view the provision of food aid to guards as equally important as providing for refugees, a stance fwb disagrees with due to their impartiality policy.
- fwb's insistence on hiring and vetting its own workforce is met with resistance, with camp authorities demanding the employment of guards.

agreed facts:
- the camp's population, exceeding [NUMBER],[NUMBER] refugees, faces severe food insecurity and nutritional deficiencies.
- health conditions in the camp are dire, with reports of malnutrition, inadequate shelter, and lack of clean water.
- both parties acknowledge the urgent need for food aid distribution to alleviate the refugees' suffering.
- the refugees are confined to the camp, relying on humanitarian aid, as indicated by both fwb's findings and camp authorities' acknowledgments.

convergent norms:
- the humanitarian obligation to provide aid and restore dignity to the displaced refugees.
- recognition of the urgent need for food assistance to prevent further humanitarian crises within the camp.
- acknowledgement of security concerns within the camp, as both parties have expressed the importance of ensuring safe and orderly distribution processes.

divergent norms:
- fwb's adherence to neutrality, independence, and impartiality conflicts with the camp authorities' demand for employing local guards and compensating them with food rations.
- the definitions of "beneficiaries" differ, with camp authorities insisting guards are also deserving of aid, whereas fwb prioritizes refugees.
- the appropriate process for identifying beneficiaries and distributing aid, especially regarding the need for a nutritional assessment.

---

recommendations:

- prioritize:
  - establishing a mutually agreeable third-party mechanism to conduct the nutritional assessment, ensuring both fwb's and the camp authorities' requirements are met without compromising on the quality and impartiality of the aid distribution process.
  - negotiating an alternative agreement that allows fwb to maintain its principles while possibly offering non-food aid or support to guards in a manner that does not detract from refugee assistance.
  - developing a detailed, transparent, and secure food distribution plan that addresses the security concerns of the camp authorities without necessitating the employment of local guards by fwb.
  - leveraging international diplomatic pressure or seeking the involvement of other humanitarian organizations to negotiate more favorable terms for fwb's operations within the camp.
  
- avoid:
  - compromising on fwb's core principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence, as this could set a concerning precedent for future negotiations and operations.
  - ignoring the potential for aid diversion, which could undermine the effectiveness of the humanitarian mission and the dignity of the aid recipients.
  - disregarding the refugee population's stance and experiences with the local guards, as their trust and cooperation are crucial for the successful distribution of aid.
  - engaging in actions that could escalate tensions with the camp authorities or the local militia, thereby endangering fwb staff, the refugee population, and the overall mission.
