### Island of Agreement Table

#### Contested Facts:
- The necessity of hiring local guards to assist in food distribution.
- The adequacy of existing data on the refugee population's nutritional status per the Camp Commander.
- The effectiveness of food rations as compensation for guards and their potential diversion.

#### Agreed Facts:
- Over 160,000 refugees are in dire need of food assistance.
- Refugees are facing severe nutritional deficiencies, inadequate shelter, and access to clean water.
- The sanitary and hygiene conditions within the camps are dire.
- The camp near the National Hero Roundabout houses the primary beneficiary population.

#### Convergent Norms:
- Recognition of the critical need for relief assistance to reach refugees.
- Agreement on the principle that food aid should be distributed to those in serious need.
- Acknowledgment by both parties that the welfare of the refugee population is of utmost importance.

#### Divergent Norms:
- FWBâ€™s insistence on neutrality, impartiality, and independence versus the camp authorities' requirement for local guard involvement in food distribution.
- FWB's policy against in-kind food payments to prevent diversion versus the Camp Commander's request for food rations as compensation.
- FWB's preference for hiring and vetting its own staff versus the local authorities' insistence on employing guards.

### Recommendations

#### Prioritize:
- Conducting a nutritional assessment to identify the most vulnerable refugees and ensure that the aid meets the actual needs, addressing the Camp Commander's reluctance with compelling evidence.
- Exploring alternative compensation for local guards that does not involve food rations, to prevent diversion of aid from refugees.
- Negotiating a compromise that allows FWB staff freedom of movement within the camp without stringent guard oversight, potentially through an increased monitoring or reporting system that satisfies security concerns.
- Engaging with international and local stakeholders, including the UN and local NGOs, to increase pressure on camp authorities for more flexible operation conditions for FWB.
- Seeking alternative means of assistance distribution that minimizes potential abuses, leveraging technology or third-party oversight if feasible.

#### Avoid:
- Agreeing to any arrangements that could compromise FWB's principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.
- Employing or compensating local guards directly in a manner that could be seen as supporting one side of the conflict.
- Any delays in the initiation of food aid distribution that could jeopardize the lives and well-being of the refugee population.
- Ignoring the potential risks of aid diversion and the exploitation of refugees by the local militia and guards.
- Overlooking the potential for engaging with broader community stakeholders to find innovative solutions to logistical and security challenges.
