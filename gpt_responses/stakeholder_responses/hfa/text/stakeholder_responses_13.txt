This Python `matplotlib` script is designed to create a visualization based on the negotiation dynamics among various stakeholders detailed in the scenario of Health for All (HfA) being detained by tribesmen in Iguwafe. It plots the tribal leaders at the origin, depicting them as the counter party with a red dot. Other involved parties such as Health for All (HfA), the local hospital staff, international donors, and others are displayed in relation to their stance on the transformative-conservative axis and their local-global influence level. This map aims to provide a strategic overview for HfA in navigating the complex stakeholder landscape.
