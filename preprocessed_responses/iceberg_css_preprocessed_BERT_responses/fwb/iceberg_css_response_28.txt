 negotiation strategy: food without borders (fwb) and camp authorities

 aspect [NUMBER]: involvement of local guards in food distribution

- counterparty (camp authorities) position, reasoning, and motives:
    - positions (what): insists on fwb employing local guards for food distribution.
    - reasoning (how): argues guards perform duties beyond security, warranting compensation akin to day laborers.
    - motives and values (why): seeks to maintain control within the camp, ensuring guards (and by extension their families) receive food as compensation, addressing food insecurity while sustaining their power structure.

- user’s organization (fwb) motives, reasoning, and positions:
    - motives and values (why): ensuring neutrality, impartiality, and preventing the diversion of aid.
    - reasoning (how): utilizes a principled stance against empowering potentially coercive local forces, to prevent compromising fwb's operational integrity and aid effectiveness.
    - positions (what): opposes hiring guards involved with local militia, advocates for the right to independently vet and hire daily laborers outside the militias.

 aspect [NUMBER]: compensation for local guards

- counterparty (camp authorities) position, reasoning, and motives:
    - positions (what): demands food rations as compensation for the services of local guards.
    - reasoning (how): justifies this by highlighting the utility of food rations in the local economy over cash, due to high market prices and scarcity of goods.
    - motives and values (why): aims to alleviate guard's food insecurity, while also potentially diverting resources for personal or militia gain.

- user’s organization (fwb) motives, reasoning, and positions:
    - motives and values (why): committed to direct and efficient aid delivery to refugees, ensuring aid is not diverted.
    - reasoning (how): believes cash compensation maintains integrity and allows for traceability of resources, avoiding propelling an illicit market.
    - positions (what): rejects food rations as compensation, preferring cash payments to safeguard aid from being hijacked.

 aspect [NUMBER]: nutritional assessment and aid distribution plan

- counterparty (camp authorities) position, reasoning, and motives:
    - positions (what): prefers immediate food distribution without new assessments.
    - reasoning (how): claims existing data is sufficient; emphasizes urgent relief to alleviate pressure on families.
    - motives and values (why): prioritizes rapid assistance, potentially to diminish internal camp strains or to avoid transparent assessments which may reveal diversion of aid.

- user’s organization (fwb) motives, reasoning, and positions:
    - motives and values (why): executes a committed approach to identify and assist those in genuine need, abiding by donor requirements for informed aid delivery.
    - reasoning (how): advocates for up-to-date, data-driven assessments to ensure correct targeting and meet donor obligations.
    - positions (what): demands completion of a new nutritional assessment before launching the food distribution to accurately address and prioritize needs.
