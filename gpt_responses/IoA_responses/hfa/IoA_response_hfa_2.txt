Based on the comprehensive details provided, here's the Island of Agreement (IoA) table summary and recommendations for Health for All (HfA) in its negotiations with the tribal leaders and other stakeholders in Iguwafe.

**Island of Agreement (IoA) Table:**

- **Contested Facts:**
  - The perception of HfA’s departure as abandonment vs. strategic redirection of resources.
  - The necessity and extent of HfA's commitment to compensating guards' families.
  - The immediacy of health service needs in Iguwafe vs. the global demand in places like Ukraine.
  - The extent of the local health crisis, particularly regarding measles outbreaks and the need for specialized surgeries.
  
- **Agreed Facts:**
  - HfA has played a critical role in providing surgical care in Iguwafe, especially for trauma victims.
  - There is a significant healthcare infrastructure deficit in rural areas of Country Beta, including Iguwafe.
  - The local hospital's operations have been disrupted since the detention of HfA staff, affecting patient care.
  - The international staff is under house arrest, with the tribesmen demanding a continuation of HfA operations in the area.

- **Convergent Norms:**
  - Both parties recognize the importance of healthcare provision in Iguwafe, particularly for vulnerable populations.
  - The safety and well-being of HfA staff are acknowledged as paramount.
  - An understanding that tribal leaders and HfA share a common goal of ensuring health services continue in some form in Iguwafe.
  
- **Divergent Norms:**
  - The method and timeline for transitioning HfA operations (with HfA pushing for an immediate shift and tribal leaders demanding a more gradual approach).
  - The perspective on HfA’s responsibility for compensating guards' families (with HfA viewing its role as primarily healthcare provision and tribal leaders seeing a broader social responsibility).
  - The role of tribal leaders in healthcare management and labor disputes.

**Recommendations:**

- **Prioritize:**
  - Establishing a clear, mutual understanding regarding the critical healthcare needs of the Iguwafe population and reaching an agreement on maintaining essential services in the short term.
  - Negotiating an amicable resolution for the safe release of HfA staff, possibly by presenting a phased withdrawal plan or a commitment to support a transition period.
  - Creating a compensation plan for the guards' families that is sensitive to local norms and expectations while being feasible for HfA.
  - Seeking partnerships or funding for measles vaccination campaigns and special surgical needs as goodwill gestures to demonstrate ongoing commitment to healthcare in Iguwafe.

- **Avoid:**
  - Dismissing the concerns of tribal leaders, local hospital staff, and the community regarding the sudden withdrawal of healthcare services.
  - Engaging in actions that could be perceived as disrespecting local norms and protocols, such as unauthorized attempts to contact detained staff.
  - Overcommitting resources or making promises HfA cannot feasibly keep, given the shift of its operations to Ukraine.
  - Ignoring the potential for enhancing HfA’s reputation and operational effectiveness through constructive dialogue and collaboration with local authorities, NGOs, and tribal leaders.
