 island of agreement (ioa) table

 contested facts:
- efficacy and necessity of a new technical assessment for nutritional status.
- adequacy of existing data on refugee population nutritional and health status.
- fwb's ability to hire non-guard labor for food distribution.
- the nature and extent of food insecurity among camp guards and their families.
- the potential for food aid diversion by the local guards.

 agreed facts:
- over [NUMBER],[NUMBER] forcibly displaced refugees are housed in the primary camp.
- refugees are facing severe nutritional deficiencies, inadequate shelter, and access to clean water.
- the local guards are affiliated with armed militias.
- both parties acknowledge the urgent need for food assistance among the refugee population.
- fwb and camp authorities recognize the complications and tensions surrounding the payment and utilization of guards in the distribution process.

 convergent norms:
- the primary objective of alleviating suffering and supporting the well-being and dignity of refugees.
- recognition that both the refugee population and the guards (to some extent) are affected by the broader crisis.
- acknowledgment of the threat posed by diversion of food aid and its impact on the effectiveness of assistance.

 divergent norms:
- fwb’s policies on neutrality, impartiality, and independence versus the camp commander’s insistence on employing guards for security and distribution roles.
- communal versus individualistic approaches to food aid distribution.
- definitions of beneficiaries: fwb focusing on refugees versus camp commander and militia leaders focusing on guards/families as well.

 recommendations

 prioritize:
- reiterating the necessity and humanitarian imperative for an updated technical nutritional assessment as per donor stipulations for targeted food aid distribution.
- establishing a mutually agreed framework for ensuring food aid reaches its intended recipients without diversion, possibly involving third-party monitoring.
- exploring hybrid solutions for incorporating local guards in logistical aspects without compromising fwb's neutrality or enabling food diversion, e.g., employing third-party local community members under fwb oversight for food distribution while offering non-food compensations to the guards for security roles.

 avoid:
- directly challenging or accusing the camp authorities of complicity in food diversion in public or contentious settings to maintain a cooperative stance for negotiations.
- accepting uncompromisable demands from the camp authorities that violate fwb’s core principles or the terms stipulated by its donors.
- overlooking the necessity of updating food distribution lists through a comprehensive assessment, which could lead to ineffective aid delivery and potential donor repercussions.
