Given the comprehensive context provided regarding the crisis between the international health organization Health for All (HfA) and the local tribesmen in Iguwafe, the negotiation landscape can be analyzed using the positions, reasoning, motives, and values of both parties. This complex situation involves multiple stakeholders, including HfA, local tribesmen, the government of Beta, and international donors, each with their specific concerns and objectives.

### Counterparty: Local Tribesmen & Community

**Aspect 1: Continuing HfA's Operations in Iguwafe**

- **Positions (What):** The local tribesmen demand that HfA reverses its decision to leave Iguwafe and continues its operations in the hospital.
- **Reasoning (How):** Their demand is based on the critical healthcare gap that HfA's departure would leave, exacerbating the health crisis in a community already suffering from lack of adequate medical care.
- **Motives and Values (Why):** The tribesmen are motivated by a sense of duty to protect their community's well-being and health security. They value community welfare and the maintenance of the healthcare services that HfA provides.

**Aspect 2: Compensation and Support for Guards’ Families**

- **Positions (What):** Demand for benefits and compensation for the hospital guards, many of whom have been injured or killed.
- **Reasoning (How):** They argue these guards took immense risks to protect HfA's operations during the conflict, and their families deserve support in recognition of their sacrifice.
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Underlying this is a strong sense of justice and fairness, as well as a commitment to community solidarity and honoring those who have contributed to their safety and well-being.

**Aspect 3: Measures Against Measles Outbreak**

- **Positions (What):** Insistence on HfA taking measures to enforce the capacity of local health authorities to manage the measles outbreak.
- **Reasoning (How):** The urgency is driven by a rapidly escalating health concern that the local system is ill-equipped to handle without HfA's support.
- **Motives and Values (Why):** The primary motive here is the health and safety of the community, especially the vulnerable populations like children. The value placed is on preventive care and the right to health.

### User’s Organization: Health for All (HfA)

**Aspect 1: Safe Release of Staff and Organizational Redirection**

- **Motives and Values (Why):** HfA values the safety and security of its team members above all. It is also driven by a mission to offer medical aid where it's most needed, guided by the urgency of conflicts like the one in Ukraine.
- **Reasoning (How):** The decision to redirect resources to Ukraine is influenced by the acute need due to the conflict and the pressure from main donors to allocate resources efficiently according to emerging global crises.
- **Positions (What):** HfA's immediate goal is the safe release of its staff detained by the tribesmen. Long-term, it seeks to transition its operations to areas with a more pressing need, guided by donor directives.

**Aspect 2: Negotiating a Transitional Plan for Iguwafe Hospital**

- **Motives and Values (Why):** Guided by principles of sustainability and responsibility, HfA aims to leave a lasting positive impact on communities it serves by ensuring that local healthcare needs can be met even in their absence.
- **Reasoning (How):** HfA acknowledges the importance of a smooth transition that doesn't leave a vacuum in healthcare services, exploring collaboration with local authorities and other NGOs for continuity.
- **Positions (What):** HfA is open to negotiating terms for a transitional plan that ensures the continuity of essential health services until a suitable replacement is found, including measures against the measles outbreak.

**Aspect 3: Financial and Operational Constraints**

- **Motives and Values (Why):** HfA operates within the confines of its financial resources and donor directives, aiming for the most effective use of its limited funding in alignment with its mission to serve those affected by crises.
- **Reasoning (How):** The operational shift to Ukraine is dictated not by a disregard for the needs of the Iguwafe community but by the necessity to address more urgent conflicts as determined by donor priorities.
- **Positions (What):** Although committed to finding a resolution for the immediate crisis in Iguwafe, HfA's position is that maintaining long-term operations there is not feasible under the current financial constraints and strategic directives.

Utilizing this structured analysis, the HfA negotiation team can approach discussions with the tribesmen and other stakeholders more strategically, aiming for a resolution that considers both the immediate crisis and the long-term healthcare needs of the Iguwafe community.
