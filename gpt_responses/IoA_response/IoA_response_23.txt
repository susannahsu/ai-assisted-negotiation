Based on the provided information, the Island of Agreement (IoA) table for the negotiation between FWB and the camp authorities can be structured as follows:

**Contested Facts:**
- The necessity and method of hiring local guards for food distribution.
- The appropriateness and relevance of conducting a new nutritional assessment within the camp.
- The most effective form of compensation for those assisting in food distribution (food rations vs. cash).
- The risk and extent of food aid diversion by local guards and militia.

**Agreed Facts:**
- Over 160,000 refugees are situated within the primary camp near the National Hero Roundabout, requiring urgent food assistance.
- The refugee population consists largely of children and women facing severe nutritional deficiencies.
- FWB is committed to delivering emergency food aid to the refugee population.
- The camp authorities have acknowledged the need for relief assistance and are willing to accept FWB's food aid.

**Convergent Norms:**
- Both parties exhibit a commitment to relieving the dire conditions faced by the refugees through food aid distribution.
- There is a shared understanding of the urgent need for action to prevent further deterioration of the refugee's situation.

**Divergent Norms:**
- FWB insists on neutrality, impartiality, and independence, including the free movement of its staff within the camp without guard supervision.
- The camp authorities demand the use of local guards in the aid distribution process and their compensation with food rations.
- The perception of refugees by the local militia and the camp authorities conflicts with international definitions and norms related to refugee rights and protections.

**Recommendations**

**Prioritize:**
- Ensuring that the refugees' immediate nutritional needs are met by facilitating the delivery of emergency food rations as swiftly as possible.
- Finding a compromise on the hiring process that respects FWB's principles while addressing the camp authorities' security concerns, possibly through vetting and training a selected group of local non-militia volunteers for the distribution process.
- Introducing a transparent mechanism to monitor food aid distribution, mitigating the risk of diversion. This could involve third-party oversight or more rigorous record-keeping and reporting.
- Establishing a clear agreement on the conduct and responsibilities of any local personnel involved in the food distribution, aligning with humanitarian principles.

**Avoid:**
- Aggravating tensions with the camp authorities by unilaterally imposing FWB's conditions without any form of negotiation or compromise.
- Overlooking the potential security risks to FWB staff, aid supplies, and refugees themselves by insisting on operating without any form of local security presence within the camp.
- Dismissing the camp authorities' proposal without first exploring all possible solutions that could allow for some form of local employment that aligns with FWB's principles.
- Ignoring the broader political and social context, including the stance of the Alpha government and local militia, which could jeopardize not only the negotiation but also the safety and effectiveness of the humanitarian operation.
