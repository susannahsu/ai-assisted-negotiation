given the complex and multifaceted situation involving health for all (hfa) and the counterparty, the local tribal leaders of iguwafe, below is a structured analysis based on the iceberg and css models, addressing three key aspects: hfa’s abrupt decision to redirect resources to ukraine, the ensuing detainment of hfa staff by local tribesmen, and the critical healthcare needs of the iguwafe district.

[NUMBER]. hfa's decision to redirect resources to ukraine

- counterparty (tribal leaders):
    - positions (what): opposition to hfa's decision to relocate resources and insistence on hfa's continued presence in iguwafe.
    - reasoning (how): the abrupt departure undermines local healthcare infrastructure and disregards prior commitments, worsening the healthcare crisis in the district.
    - motives and values (why): priority on local community health and welfare, maintaining the trust and investments in the collaborations formed, and ensuring continuation of essential services.

- user’s organization (hfa):
    - motives and values (why): commitment to addressing the most urgent global healthcare needs, following donor directives, and optimizing resource allocation in conflict zones.
    - reasoning (how): the necessity to shift focus to ukraine due to higher immediate war-surgery needs and donor pressure, despite ongoing local needs in iguwafe.
    - positions (what): closure of operations in iguwafe and transfer of the surgical team to ukraine.

[NUMBER]. detainment of hfa staff by local tribesmen

- counterparty (tribal leaders):
    - positions (what): enforced house arrest of hfa staff to prevent their departure.
    - reasoning (how): to leverage hfa into reconsidering their departure and continuing healthcare services.
    - motives and values (why): ensuring the healthcare needs of the community are met, protecting local interests, and negotiating for the stability of services.

- user’s organization (hfa):
    - motives and values (why): ensuring the safety and well-being of staff, commitment to humanitarian principles, and aversion to giving in to coercive measures.
    - reasoning (how): soliciting diplomatic and local support to secure release, emphasizing dialogue over confrontation while maintaining a stance against ransom.
    - positions (what): negotiating for staff release without yielding to what are perceived as extortion tactics, ensuring continuation of urgent medical services where possible.

[NUMBER]. addressing the critical healthcare needs of the iguwafe district

- counterparty (tribal leaders):
    - positions (what): demand for the continuation of hfa's medical services, including war surgery and addressing new emerging health issues like measles outbreaks.
    - reasoning (how): the district’s reliance on hfa for critical healthcare due to the absence of local capacity and other providers.
    - motives and values (why): upholding community health and welfare, preventing further deterioration of the public health situation.

- user’s organization (hfa):
    - motives and values (why): advocating for health equity and access to care, fulfilling organizational mission within resource constraints, desire to prevent health crisis exacerbation.
    - reasoning (how): exploring partnerships or transitions to local health officials or ngos, securing ad-hoc medical campaigns (like measles vaccination), and seeking to leave a sustainable legacy.
    - positions (what): willingness to negotiate short-term medical support solutions while transitioning focus to ukraine, securing staff release as a precondition for further aid.

in navigating this negotiation, hfa must balance immediate safety concerns with long-term healthcare goals, striving for a solution that respects both organizational commitments and the critical needs of the iguwafe community. the structured negotiation approach facilitates the identification of shared goals, like community health welfare, and could guide towards mutually beneficial outcomes.
