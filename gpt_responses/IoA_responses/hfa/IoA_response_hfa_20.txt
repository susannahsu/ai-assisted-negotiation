### Recommendations

#### Prioritize:
- Ensuring the safety and eventual release of detained HfA staff by establishing trust and dialogue with tribal leaders.
- Acknowledging the critical healthcare needs of the Iguwafe population, especially regarding measles outbreaks and the necessity of surgical care.
- Considering a phased transition strategy for HfA operations in Beta that includes local capacity building and finding alternative healthcare providers to avoid leaving a vacuum.
- Exploring potential compensations or support mechanisms for the families of deceased or injured local guards as a goodwill gesture.

#### Avoid:
- Making any commitments without securing clear and actionable assurances for the safety and release of HfA staff.
- Undermining the tribal leaders and local authorities, recognizing their influence and importance in the resolution of the situation.
- Ignoring the broader implications of the departure decision on HfA’s reputation, future operations, and relationships in other conflict-affected regions.
- Disregarding the potential for collaborative solutions with other NGOs, local government, and donors to ensure the sustainability of healthcare services in Iguwafe.
