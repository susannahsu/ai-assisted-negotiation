 aspect [NUMBER]: hiring local guards for food distribution

counterparty (camp authorities)

- positions: insist that fwb must hire local guards to assist in the food ration distribution process.
- reasoning: the guards' duties include maintaining order during distribution; since they're familiar with the camp environment, they're seen as necessary for the smooth running of operations.
- motives and values: ensuring that the camp's security apparatus, closely tied to the militia, retains influence and control over camp activities, including humanitarian assistance.

user’s organization (fwb)

- motives and values: adherence to principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence, not empowering parties to the conflict or compromising the humanitarian mission.
- reasoning: hiring local guards associated with militias could compromise fwb's independence and potentially lead to the diversion of aid away from the refugees.
- positions: fwb refrains from hiring local guards for distribution, proposing alternatives such as hiring neutral daily laborers from the local community not associated with the militia.

 aspect [NUMBER]: compensation for guards

counterparty (camp authorities)

- positions: demand that local guards receive compensation in the form of food rations for their services.

summary

the negotiation between fwb and the camp authorities revolves around critical operational aspects vital for humanitarian aid delivery that reflect deeper discrepancies between fwb's humanitarian motives and the camp authorities' control-oriented motives. fwb must navigate these negotiations carefully, considering both the imperative need to provide aid efficiently and the broader ethical concerns affecting all parties involved.
