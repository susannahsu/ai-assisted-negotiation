This script produces a visual representation of the stakeholders involved in the negotiation related to Food Without Borders (FWB) assisting refugees in Alpha. The counter party, camp authorities, is placed at the origin and marked in red. Each stakeholder's position signifies their inclination towards transformative vs. conservative approaches (x-axis) and their influence from local to global (y-axis). FWB is highlighted in green as the user party striving for a negotiation outcome favorable to its mission of humanitarian assistance. Additional stakeholders, ranging from international organizations like the UN, local NGOs, government officials, and refugee leaders, are plotted to showcase their varying alignments and influences in the scenario. This map serves as a foundation for strategizing negotiation approaches and identifying potential alliances or oppositions.
