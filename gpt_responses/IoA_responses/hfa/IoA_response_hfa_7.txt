Based on the comprehensive details provided, here's the Island of Agreement (IoA) table and recommendations for HfA's negotiation with the tribal leaders regarding the situation in Iguwafe.

**Island of Agreement (IoA) Table**

- **Contested Facts**:
    1. HfA's abrupt decision to depart from Iguwafe without sufficient local consultation.
    2. The intended closure of HfA’s operations is seen as a labor dispute by HfA but as extortion/hostage situation by the tribesmen.
    3. Mismanagement of relations with local tribal leaders and the community by HfA.
    4. Compensation demands by the families of deceased or disabled local guards.

- **Agreed Facts**:
    1. HfA provided essential surgical care in Iguwafe, benefiting the community, especially during conflict times.
    2. Healthcare infrastructure in Beta, including Iguwafe, is severely compromised, underscoring the importance of HfA's services.
    3. The local population is currently facing an increase in measles cases, with a lack of alternative healthcare services.
    4. The safety and security of HfA’s staff are of paramount importance for both HfA and the tribal leaders.

- **Convergent Norms**:
    1. The right of the population of Iguwafe to access healthcare services.
    2. The mutual understanding of the need for local guards and the hospital's staff well-being.
    3. Acknowledgment of the value brought by HfA to the local healthcare system and the population’s well-being.
    4. Importance of dialogue and negotiation to solve the current crisis.

- **Divergent Norms**:
    1. The role of HfA in compensating local guards and their families.
    2. Interpretation of HfA's operational shutdown as abandonment vs. necessary reallocation due to donor pressures.
    3. The necessity and extent of HfA's continued operations in Iguwafe.
    4. The perceived obligations of HfA to the community versus its global mission priorities.

**Recommendations for Negotiation Strategy:**

- **Prioritize**:
    1. Confirming the immediate security and safety of the HfA staff.
    2. Establishing a phased transition plan for HfA's services in Iguwafe to local or government healthcare providers.
    3. Demonstrating a commitment to addressing the measles outbreak as an immediate healthcare priority.
    4. Opening a dialogue for compensation for the families of deceased or injured local guards within a defined legal framework.
    5. Exploring opportunities for collaboration with other NGOs or governmental bodies to ensure continuity of essential services at the hospital.

- **Avoid**:
    1. Any actions or communications that could be perceived as undermining the authority or concerns of the tribal leaders and local guards.
    2. Making promises beyond HfA's capacity to deliver, to prevent false expectations.
    3. Dismissing the importance of local customs, including the process for negotiating with tribal leaders.
    4. Ignoring the broader implications of HfA's departure on the local healthcare infrastructure and patient care continuity.

This structured approach aims at not only securing the release of the detained staff but also at ensuring that HfA's transition out of Iguwafe does not compromise the community's access to essential healthcare services.
