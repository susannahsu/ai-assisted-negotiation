Given the complex and multifaceted crisis that Health for All (HfA) faces in Iguwafe, the delegation can use the Iceberg and Common Shared Space (CSS) models to navigate this negotiation effectively. By breaking down the positions, reasoning, motives, and values of both the counterparty (tribal leaders and affiliated locals) and HfA, strategies can be developed. 

**Aspect 1: Hospital Operations and Staff Safety**

**Counterparty:**
- Positions (What): Desire for continued hospital operations and safety guarantees for detained staff.
- Reasoning (How): The hospital's operations are central to the community’s health needs, especially considering the measles outbreak and the need for various medical surgeries.
- Motives and Values (Why): Ensuring the wellbeing of the community, reinforcing the tribal authority, and justice for the guards' families.

**User’s Organization (HfA):**
- Motives and Values (Why): Commitment to providing medical aid, staff safety, and ensuring a responsible exit strategy that does not negatively impact community health infrastructure.
- Reasoning (How): Considering the high dependency of the community on the hospital for surgical and healthcare needs alongside the immediate need for staff safety requires balancing commitments with donors and ethical responsibility towards the Iguwafe community.
- Positions (What): Willingness to discuss operational transitions and negotiate safe release and working conditions for detained staff.

**Aspect 2: Compensation for Local Guards’ Families**

**Counterparty:**
- Positions (What): Seek compensation for the families of guards who have been affected.
- Reasoning (How): The guards played a pivotal role in maintaining safety and enabling HfA operations during critical periods.
- Motives and Values (Why): Acknowledgment and restitution for sacrifices made, supporting families who have lost their breadwinners.

**User’s Organization (HfA):**
- Motives and Values (Why): Recognizing the value of local partnerships, equitable treatment, and the importance of acknowledging sacrifices made by local collaborators.
- Reasoning (How): To maintain goodwill within the community and ensure smooth operations, compensation or acknowledgments for the guards’ families could be considered within HfA's capabilities and donor constraints.
- Positions (What): Open to discussing compensation mechanisms while ensuring staff safety is prioritized.

**Aspect 3: Resolving Funding and Operational Priorities**

**Counterparty:**
- Positions (What): Expectation for HfA to re-establish hospital operations fully.
- Reasoning (How): HfA’s operations are seen as critical to addressing the community's immediate health crises, such as measles outbreaks and surgical needs.
- Motives and Values (Why): Prioritization of community health needs and autonomy in handling local health crises without over-reliance on external entities.

**User’s Organization (HfA):**
- Motives and Values (Why): Balancing donor demands with on-ground realities, adhering to organizational mission without harming host communities.
- Reasoning (How): Reallocation of resources under donor pressure must be approached carefully, ensuring that the transition does not abruptly leave a healthcare void in Iguwafe.
- Positions (What): Negotiation for phased withdrawal or seeking partnerships with other NGOs to take over operations, while ensuring appropriate measles response capabilities are developed locally.

**Strategy Moving Forward:**

The delegation should leverage the CSS model to identify overlaps in the interests of HfA and the tribal leaders – primarily the health and welfare of the Iguwafe community and the safety of the HfA staff. By focusing on shared values of health and community wellbeing, the negotiation can transition from confrontational to cooperative, seeking solutions that align with the interests of both parties. Exploring compromises, such as temporarily maintaining essential services while facilitating a transfer of operations to local health authorities or other NGOs, and addressing the compensation for local guards’ families in a manner respectful to all parties involved, could be key strategies.
