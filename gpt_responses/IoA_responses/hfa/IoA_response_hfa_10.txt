Based on the extensive background information provided regarding the situation involving the Health for All (HfA) organization in Iguwafe, Country Beta, the following Island of Agreement (IoA) table is constructed to facilitate the upcoming negotiation between HfA representatives and the tribal leaders:

**Contested Facts:**
- The cause and responsibility for the crisis at the local hospital.
- The local perception of HfA's departure as abrupt and without adequate local consultation.
- The exact role and expectations regarding the hospital guards and their compensation.
- The current and future health needs of the Iguwafe community and the best ways to address them.
- HfA's capabilities and obligations concerning continuing operations in Iguwafe.

**Agreed Facts:**
- HfA has significantly contributed to the healthcare infrastructure in Iguwafe, especially in providing surgical care.
- The local hospital is now non-operational, leaving many patients without essential care.
- The international staff of HfA are under house arrest by local armed tribesmen.
- There is a pressing global demand for medical resources, influencing HfA to consider relocating its surgical team to Ukraine.

**Convergent Norms:**
- The safety and well-being of the detained HfA staff are of paramount importance to both parties.
- The healthcare needs of the Iguwafe community are urgent and significant, especially concerning surgical care and measles outbreaks.
- Respect for local customs, including the role of tribal leaders in community matters.
- Acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by hospital guards during times of unrest.

**Divergent Norms:**
- Views on HfA's decision to redirect resources to Ukraine and the impact of this decision on Iguwafe's healthcare services.
- Opinions on the responsibility for healthcare provision in Iguwafe moving forward.
- Perspectives on appropriate compensation and recognition for the hospital guards and their families.

**Recommendations:**
- **Prioritize:**
  1. Establishing a communication framework that honors tribal customs and authority while ensuring direct dialogue on critical issues.
  2. Discussing a transition plan that considers the immediate and short-term healthcare needs of Iguwafe, possibly involving a temporary continuation of some HfA activities or support to keep the hospital operational.
  3. Exploring options for compensating the families of the hospital guards, possibly with the involvement of other NGOs or local authorities.
  4. Emphasizing shared values and objectives, particularly the well-being of the Iguwafe community and the safety of HfA staff, to build goodwill.
  
- **Avoid:**
  1. Dismissing local norms and expectations regarding respect for tribal leaders and customs.
  2. Ignoring the broader context of healthcare needs in Iguwafe, including beyond emergency surgical care.
  3. Making promises that HfA cannot realistically fulfill given the current funding and resource constraints.
  4. Escalating tensions through unauthorized attempts to contact the detained staff or bypassing tribal leaders in decision-making processes.
