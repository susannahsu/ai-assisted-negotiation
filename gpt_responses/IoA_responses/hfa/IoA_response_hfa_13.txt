Given the complex and multifaceted situation surrounding the Health for All (HfA) staff's detention by tribal leaders in Iguwafe and the organization's operations, here is a summary of the critical elements for an Island of Agreement (IoA) negotiation table, and recommendations for the negotiation strategies:

### Island of Agreement Table

- **Contested Facts:**
  - Whether HfA's departure amounts to abandoning the district hospital's needs.
  - The conditions and characterizations of HfA staff's detention.
  - The responsibilities and obligations of HfA towards local guards and their families.
  - The feasibility and requirements to restart hospital operations immediately.

- **Agreed Facts:**
  - HfA played a crucial role in providing surgical and healthcare services in Iguwafe.
  - There is a pressing need for healthcare services in Iguwafe, including surgery, maternal health, and response to measles outbreak.
  - The local healthcare infrastructure cannot support the population's needs without external aid.
  - HfA is under pressure from donors to redirect resources to Ukraine.

- **Convergent Norms:**
  - Recognition of the urgent need for medical services and healthcare in Iguwafe.
  - Acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by local guards and the need to recognize these.
  - Agreement on the importance of maintaining peaceful and constructive dialogues.

- **Divergent Norms:**
  - Views on HfA's responsibility to continue operations in Beta versus relocating resources to Ukraine.
  - Perceptions of whether HfA's departure is a breach of ethical obligations to the Iguwafe community.
  - Approaches to compensating the families of local guards.
  - Standards and protocols in managing labor disputes and treatment of detained international staff.

### Recommendations

- **Prioritize:**
  - Establishing a clear understanding of HfA's capacity to maintain a limited presence in Iguwafe or contribute to a transition plan that ensures continuity of medical services.
  - Negotiating short-term solutions to immediate healthcare crises, particularly addressing the measles outbreak and critical surgical needs.
  - Exploring possibilities for compensating the families of local guards in collaboration with tribal leaders.
  - Emphasizing a commitment to respectful dialogue and understanding to ensure the safety and eventual release of detained staff.

- **Avoid:**
  - Any further actions or statements that could be interpreted as disrespectful or undermining the authority of the tribal leaders.
  - Engaging in negotiations that would set a precedent for HfA's operations globally, such as agreeing to terms that compromise the organization's principles of independence and neutrality.
  - Public accusations or confrontations that could escalate tension.
  - Allowing the situation to stagnate without taking proactive steps to find a resolution that respects both HfA's mission and the local community's needs.
