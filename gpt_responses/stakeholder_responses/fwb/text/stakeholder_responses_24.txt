Based on the extensive information provided, we can identify and map the key stakeholders involved in the negotiation context of the Food Without Borders (FWB) organization assisting refugees in Alpha. To facilitate a clear understanding and visualization of this complex situation, a stakeholder map will be designed and created, pinpointing the positions of each identified party based on their inclination towards change (transformative to conservative) and their influence (local to global).

Given the detailed scenario, here are the identified stakeholders and their presumed positions:

1. **FWB** (User Party): As the protagonist, FWB is deeply invested in delivering humanitarian aid while maintaining its principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence. It seeks to distribute food aid without direct involvement of the local guards affiliated with militias, which puts it at odds with the camp authorities.
   
2. **Camp Authorities** (Counter Party): The camp authorities, including the Camp Commander and the Camp Administration, are at the center of the negotiation, counter to FWB’s objectives due by insisting on control over the aid distribution process through the involvement of local guards.

3. **Local Guards and Militia**: Affiliated with the camp authorities, they are placed close to the counterparty due to their direct opposition to FWB's operational principles but slightly inclined towards conservatism due to their interest in maintaining control over the distribution of aid for their own benefit.

4. **Refugees** (including Refugee Leaders): Their need for aid places them in alignment with FWB but their position is highly impacted by local dynamics, making their influence largely local but critically important to FWB’s mission.

5. **German Government**: As a significant donor insisting on nutritional assessments before aid distribution, it has global influence and a relatively conservative approach compared to FWB’s pressing plan to distribute food aid.

6. **UN Humanitarian Coordinator**: With global influence and a transformative inclination towards improving the refugees' conditions, this stakeholder supports FWB's mission from a global perspective.

7. **Local Church Activists and NGOs like MASHA and Health for All**: These parties show local to mild global influence with transformative inclinations similar to FWB, aiming for the betterment of refugees' lives despite challenging conditions.

8. **Alpha Government and its Defense Ministry**: Viewing refugees as potential threats and insisting on strict camp regulation, their position is more conservative and their influence is mostly local with some global impact due to the geopolitical stance.

9. **Council of Omega Abroad**: Representing the refugees' home country's interests with a global perspective and transformative inclinations, advocating for international support for the refugees.

10. **Local Village Mayor**: Has a local influence, with a conservative view mostly aligning with the camp authorities due to economic dependences but slightly open to negotiation on the employment and compensation strategies FWB proposes.

11. **Local Press**: Reflects and possibly shapes local public opinion, positioned conservatively due to its support for the government's efforts and approach towards refugees.

The graphical representation will plot these stakeholders based on their identified positions, ensuring a comprehensive visualization of the negotiation landscape FWB is navigating.

# Plotting other stakeholders

# Adding labels to the points
for label, (x, y) in stakeholders.items():

ax.annotate('Camp Authorities', (0, 0), textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line

This script will create a visual representation mapping each stakeholder's position relative to their inclination towards change and their level of influence from local to global.
