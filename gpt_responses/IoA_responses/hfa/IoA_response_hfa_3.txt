### Island of Agreement (IoA) Table

**Contested Facts:**
- The categorization of the detained HfA staff (hostages vs. guests according to local customs).
- The responsibilities of HfA toward the local guards' families and the broader community's healthcare needs.
- The feasibility and appropriateness of HfA's complete withdrawal from Iguwafe vs. a transition to local management or another NGO.
- The effectiveness and intent behind HfA's operational priorities, including the sudden shift to Ukraine.

**Agreed Facts:**
- The local healthcare infrastructure in Beta, especially in rural areas like Iguwafe, is critically dependent on international NGOs such as HfA.
- The recent shift in HfA's mission due to donor pressure has ramifications for the local healthcare system and the community's well-being.
- The local guards played a significant role in maintaining security for HfA operations during periods of conflict.
- The critical healthcare needs in Iguwafe are ongoing and diverse, including surgical care for various injuries and addressing a measles outbreak.

**Convergent Norms:**
- The importance of maintaining essential health services in Iguwafe, particularly given the high burden of disease and lack of local healthcare infrastructure.
- The foundational principle of humanitarian aid to alleviate suffering and provide support to the most vulnerable populations.
- The recognition of mutual respect and the need for dialogue between HfA and the local community, including tribal leaders.

**Divergent Norms:**
- The approach to managing the transition of healthcare services in Iguwafe, whether by continuing HfA operations, transitioning to local health authorities, or finding another NGO to take over.
- The perception of HfA's withdrawal strategy (abrupt departure vs. necessary shift due to external pressures).
- The role and acknowledgment of local guards and their welfare within the broader context of HfA's mission and responsibilities.

### Recommendations on What to Prioritize and What to Avoid in Negotiation

**Prioritize:**
- Establishing a clear understanding and acknowledgment of HfA's contributions and the critical health needs of the Iguwafe community.
- Seeking a mutually agreeable solution for transitioning healthcare services that minimizes interruption and considers local capabilities and needs.
- Addressing the concerns of the local guards' families and the community in a manner that honors their contributions and sacrifices.
- Ensuring the immediate safety and well-being of the detained HfA staff while respecting local customs and authority structures.

**Avoid:**
- Dismissing the local community and tribal leaders' perspectives and concerns regarding HfA's transition strategy.
- Ignoring the broader impact of HfA's operations and withdrawal on the local healthcare ecosystem and community welfare.
- Underestimating the complexity and sensitivity of negotiating a resolution that respects both HfA's mission and the needs of the Iguwafe community.
- Rushing to a resolution without adequately engaging with and understanding the diverse stakeholders involved (local hospital staff, tribal leaders, patient associations, and others).
