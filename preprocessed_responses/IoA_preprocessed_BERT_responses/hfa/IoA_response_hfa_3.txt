 recommendations on what to prioritize and what to avoid in negotiation

prioritize:
- establishing a clear understanding and acknowledgment of hfa's contributions and the critical health needs of the iguwafe community.
- seeking a mutually agreeable solution for transitioning healthcare services that minimizes interruption and considers local capabilities and needs.
- addressing the concerns of the local guards' families and the community in a manner that honors their contributions and sacrifices.
- ensuring the immediate safety and well-being of the detained hfa staff while respecting local customs and authority structures.

avoid:
- dismissing the local community and tribal leaders' perspectives and concerns regarding hfa's transition strategy.
- ignoring the broader impact of hfa's operations and withdrawal on the local healthcare ecosystem and community welfare.
- underestimating the complexity and sensitivity of negotiating a resolution that respects both hfa's mission and the needs of the iguwafe community.
- rushing to a resolution without adequately engaging with and understanding the diverse stakeholders involved (local hospital staff, tribal leaders, patient associations, and others).
