Given the comprehensive situation described, our goal is to create a stakeholder map that visually represents the intricate dynamics within the negotiation environs of Health for All (HfA) in Iguwafe, Country Beta. This involves positioning stakeholders based on their inclination towards change (conservative to transformative) and their overall influence (local to global).

To construct this visualization accurately, we identify the key stakeholders:

1. **HfA (Protagonist)**: An international health organization aimed at providing medical aid in conflict zones, currently needing to redirect resources to Ukraine due to donor pressure.
2. **Tribal Leaders (Counterparty)**: Local authority figures in Iguwafe, holding HfA staff in a form of house arrest to retaliate against HfA's planned closure of local operations.
3. **Local Hospital Staff and Patients**: Dependent on HfA's presence for medical services and employment, facing the immediate impact of HfA's potential departure.
4. **Local Government and Police**: Display a non-interventionist stance, viewing the conflict as a labor dispute, yet underline the role of HfA in local healthcare provision.
5. **International Donors (Germany and Switzerland)**: Exert financial pressure on HfA to relocate resources to Ukraine, emphasizing conflict-centric aid over development-centric aid.
6. **Other NGOs (e.g., Food Without Borders, Child Protection International)**: Offer varying levels of support and insight into the local context, balancing between understanding HfA's situation and advocating for continued local support.
7. **UN Representatives**: Advocate for dialogue and caution against abrupt operational shifts, stressing the importance of coordination in crisis situations.
8. **Local Communities and Guards**: Directly affected by HfA's operational adjustments, with guards and their families facing severe economic repercussions.
9. **Media**: Plays a critical role in shaping public opinion, often critical of HfA's withdrawal plans.

Let's proceed to plot these stakeholders on the map.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party (Tribal Leaders)
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Tribal Leaders')  # 'ro' for red circle

# Stakeholder coordinates and labels
stakeholders = {
    'HfA (Protagonist)': (5, 5),
    'Local Hospital Staff': (-2, 2),
    'Patients': (-3, 1),
    'Local Government and Police': (0, -3),
    'International Donors': (7, 8),
    'Other NGOs': (-4, 6),
    'UN Representatives': (-5, 7),
    'Local Communities and Guards': (-1, -2),
    'Media': (-4, -1)
}

# Plot stakeholders
for label, coords in stakeholders.items():
    ax.plot(*coords, 'bo')  # Blue dot for stakeholders

    # Adding labels to the points
    ax.annotate(label, coords, textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Show the plot
output_file_path = os.path.join('gpt_responses/plots', f'plot{run_number}.png')
plt.savefig(output_file_path)
```

This script, once executed, will generate a visual representation of the negotiation landscape HfA is navigating in Iguwafe. Each stakeholder's position reflects their propensity for change versus conservatism and their influence from a local to a global scale.
