This Python script generates a stakeholder map for the Food Without Borders (FWB) negotiations scenario concerning food assistance within a refugee camp in Country Alpha. It outlines the positions of various stakeholders, including the camp authorities, FWB, donor entities like the German government, local NGOs, and other influential parties within and outside the camp's context. 

The placement of each stakeholder symbolizes their stance on transformative change versus conservative approaches (horizontal axis) and their influence from local to global levels (vertical axis). The Camp Authorities are placed at the origin to indicate their central role in opposition to FWB's objectives. This map provides a visual overview to support FWB in strategizing negotiations and interactions with these actors to fulfill their mission effectively.
