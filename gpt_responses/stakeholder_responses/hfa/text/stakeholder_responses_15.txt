Given the detailed context of the negotiation involving Health for All (HfA), Tribal Leaders, and other stakeholders in Iguwafe, let's structure a stakeholder map to visualize the negotiation landscape. This visualization will help in identifying the primary and counter parties, their positions, and influence levels, thereby aiding in strategizing negotiation paths effectively.

### Stakeholders Identification:

- **Primary Party (Protagonist)**: Health for All (HfA)
- **Counterparty**: Tribal Leaders

Other stakeholders include:

- The local hospital staff and patients (including the Patient Association of Iguwafe)
- The Government of Country Beta and specific sectors within it (e.g., the Health Minister, local police chief, local head of District Administration)
- International backers (Germany and Switzerland)
- Local guards and their families
- International organizations (UN, CPI, FWB)
- Local community, including media and families affected by the healthcare situation

### Stakeholder Map Script:

This script places HfA as the protagonist and the Tribal Leaders as the counterparty, along with positioning other stakeholders based on their inclination towards transformative change (regarding healthcare and international support) and their local to global influence.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Inclination (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Influence (Local to Global)')

# Plot the counterparty (Tribal Leaders) at the origin
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Tribal Leaders')  # Red dot for Tribal Leaders

# Plot other stakeholders
# Influence and inclination values are indicative and should be adjusted as per detailed stakeholder analysis

# HfA - protagonist
hfa_x, hfa_y = 5, 8  # Assuming desire to move resources is a transformative action but globally influenced
ax.plot(hfa_x, hfa_y, 'go', label='Health for All')  # Green dot for HfA

# Local Hospital and Patients
hospital_x, hospital_y = 3, 1
ax.plot(hospital_x, hospital_y, 'bo', label='Local Hospital & Patients')  # Blue dot

# Government (Local and National)
government_x, government_y = -2, 7
ax.plot(government_x, government_y, 'co', label='Government of Beta')  # Cyan dot

# International Backers (Germany and Switzerland)
backers_x, backers_y = 7, 9
ax.plot(backers_x, backers_y, 'mo', label='International Backers')  # Magenta dot

# UN and Other NGOs
un_x, un_y = 2, 6
ax.plot(un_x, un_y, 'yo', label='UN & NGOs')  # Yellow dot

# Local Community
community_x, community_y = -3, 2
ax.plot(community_x, community_y, 'ko', label='Local Community')  # Black dot for local community

# Local Guards and Families
guards_x, guards_y = -4, 3
ax.plot(guards_x, guards_y, 'b^', label='Local Guards & Families')  # Blue triangle for guards

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Adding labels to the points
labels = ['Tribal Leaders', 'Health for All', 'Local Hospital & Patients', 'Government of Beta',
          'International Backers', 'UN & NGOs', 'Local Community', 'Local Guards & Families']
coords = [(0,0), (hfa_x, hfa_y), (hospital_x, hospital_y), (government_x, government_y),
          (backers_x, backers_y), (un_x, un_y), (community_x, community_y), (guards_x, guards_y)]

for i, txt in enumerate(labels):
    ax.annotate(txt, coords[i], textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Show the plot
output_file_path = os.path.join('gpt_responses/plots', f'plot{np.random.randint(10000)}.png')
plt.savefig(output_file_path)
plt.show()
```

This script creates a stakeholder map that visualizes positions of HfA, Tribal Leaders, and other relevant parties involved in the negotiation in Iguwafe. Stakeholder positions are indicative and based on the described negotiation dynamics. The map aids in strategizing the negotiation by highlighting relationships and potential pathways towards resolution.
