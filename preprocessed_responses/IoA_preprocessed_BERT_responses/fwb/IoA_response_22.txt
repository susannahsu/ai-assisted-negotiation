 island of agreement table

 contested facts:
- the necessity of hiring local guards to assist in food distribution.
- the adequacy of existing data on the refugee population's nutritional status per the camp commander.
- the effectiveness of food rations as compensation for guards and their potential diversion.

 agreed facts:
- over [NUMBER],[NUMBER] refugees are in dire need of food assistance.
- refugees are facing severe nutritional deficiencies, inadequate shelter, and access to clean water.
- the sanitary and hygiene conditions within the camps are dire.
- the camp near the national hero roundabout houses the primary beneficiary population.

 convergent norms:
- recognition of the critical need for relief assistance to reach refugees.
- agreement on the principle that food aid should be distributed to those in serious need.
- acknowledgment by both parties that the welfare of the refugee population is of utmost importance.

 divergent norms:
- fwbâ€™s insistence on neutrality, impartiality, and independence versus the camp authorities' requirement for local guard involvement in food distribution.
- fwb's policy against in-kind food payments to prevent diversion versus the camp commander's request for food rations as compensation.
- fwb's preference for hiring and vetting its own staff versus the local authorities' insistence on employing guards.

 recommendations

 prioritize:
- conducting a nutritional assessment to identify the most vulnerable refugees and ensure that the aid meets the actual needs, addressing the camp commander's reluctance with compelling evidence.
- exploring alternative compensation for local guards that does not involve food rations, to prevent diversion of aid from refugees.
- negotiating a compromise that allows fwb staff freedom of movement within the camp without stringent guard oversight, potentially through an increased monitoring or reporting system that satisfies security concerns.
- engaging with international and local stakeholders, including the un and local ngos, to increase pressure on camp authorities for more flexible operation conditions for fwb.
- seeking alternative means of assistance distribution that minimizes potential abuses, leveraging technology or third-party oversight if feasible.

 avoid:
- agreeing to any arrangements that could compromise fwb's principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.
- employing or compensating local guards directly in a manner that could be seen as supporting one side of the conflict.
- any delays in the initiation of food aid distribution that could jeopardize the lives and well-being of the refugee population.
- ignoring the potential risks of aid diversion and the exploitation of refugees by the local militia and guards.
- overlooking the potential for engaging with broader community stakeholders to find innovative solutions to logistical and security challenges.
