Based on the provided series of events and meetings concerning the Health for All (HfA) situation in Iguwafe, the following Island of Agreement (IoA) table is constructed to facilitate the negotiations:

### Contested Facts:
- Whether HfA's abrupt decision to leave should warrant compensation to local guards and their families.
- The adequacy and future of healthcare services in Iguwafe post-HfA departure.
- The security situation's characterization: labor dispute vs. hostage scenario.

### Agreed Facts:
- HfA played a critical role in providing crucial healthcare services during and post-conflict.
- The importance of the surgical team at the local hospital, given the absence of alternative providers in the district.
- The presence of a pressing healthcare need, particularly regarding measles outbreaks and surgical care.

### Convergent Norms:
- The safety of HfA staff is of paramount importance to all parties involved.
- Healthcare provision, especially for vulnerable populations such as children with surgery needs, is a shared value.
- Tribal leaders and other local stakeholders are interested in finding a resolution to continue healthcare services.

### Divergent Norms:
- Prioritization of HfA's resources and focus: local vs. international needs (Ukraine conflict).
- Perception of HfA’s responsibility toward local guards and the community for ongoing and future healthcare services.
- The role of traditional and local authorities vs. the national government in health care provision and labor disputes.

### Recommendations:

#### Prioritize:
- Transparent communication with all stakeholders about HfA's capacity, plans, and constraints.
- Engagement with tribal leaders to secure the immediate release of the detained staff, as their safety is non-negotiable.
- Exploring partnerships or transitional plans with local authorities, NGOs like FWB, and international entities to ensure the continuity of healthcare services, particularly for vulnerable populations and critical cases like the measles outbreak.
- Addressing the compensation concerns of the local guards and community directly affected by HfA’s departure, demonstrating acknowledgment of their sacrifices and contributions.

#### Avoid:
- Any unilateral decisions without thorough consultation with local stakeholders, to prevent further misunderstanding and resistance.
- Confrontational approaches with tribal leaders and the local community that could exacerbate tensions and endanger HfA staff further.
- Immediate full withdrawal without establishing a contingency plan for healthcare services, as this could lead to dire healthcare crises and loss of trust in HfA and similar organizations.
- Overlooking the broader role and impact of international aid dynamics on local healthcare ecosystems, stressing the need for sustainable solutions beyond HfA’s temporary presence.
