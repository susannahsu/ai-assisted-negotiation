### Island of Agreement Table

**Contested Facts:**
- The need for FWB to hire local guards for the food distribution process.
- The necessity of compensating these guards in the form of food rations.
- The adequacy of existing nutritional status data within the camp as argued by the Camp Commander.
- The efficacy and safety of allowing guards to oversee FWB's food distribution.

**Agreed Facts:**
- Over 160,000 refugees are settled in the primary camp, facing severe nutritional deficiencies and inadequate access to clean water and shelter.
- Both parties acknowledge the urgency of distributing food rations to the refugee population.
- There is a continuous influx of new arrivals, primarily women and children, into the camps.
- The camp is under the control of local authorities linked with militias.

**Convergent Norms:**
- There is a shared understanding of the emergency nature of the food assistance required by the refugees.
- Both parties recognize the importance of security within the camp during the distribution process.
- Acknowledgement from both FWB and camp authorities regarding the plight of the refugees and the critical need for humanitarian assistance.

**Divergent Norms:**
- FWB’s commitment to neutrality, impartiality, and independence versus the camp authorities' insistence on hiring local guards.
- The method of compensation for workers involved in the food distribution process.
- The process and criteria for determining the beneficiaries of the food aid.

### Recommendations

**Prioritize:**
- Establishing an agreement on conducting an independent nutritional assessment by FWB to ensure food aid reaches those in dire need, potentially involving a neutral third party to validate findings.
- Negotiating an arrangement that maintains FWB's principles of neutrality and independence while satisfying the camp authorities' security concerns. This could involve hiring vetted individuals from the local community who are not affiliated with the militias but can be trained and supervised by FWB.
- Exploring alternative compensatory mechanisms that could be acceptable to both parties, such as direct benefits to the camp (e.g., infrastructure improvements, healthcare services) instead of in-kind food payments or employing a voucher system that guards can use for essentials within or outside the camp.
- Engaging with international bodies and the host government to ensure a broader framework of operation that enhances FWB's leverage and security of operations.

**Avoid:**
- Yielding to the demand to employ militia-affiliated guards directly without proper vetting and oversight mechanisms.
- Compromising FWB’s core principles, as this could endanger the trust and safety of the refugees and the mission’s integrity.
- Delaying the food distribution over protracted negotiations, given the urgent nutritional needs of the refugees.
- Ignoring the potential for compromise solutions that could address the camp authorities' concerns while ensuring FWB's operational guidelines and principles are upheld.
