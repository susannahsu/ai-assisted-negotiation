Given the complexity of the scenario involving the Health for All (HfA) organization's staff being detained by tribal groups in Iguwafe, Country Beta, this situation necessitates a detailed stakeholder mapping to better understand and navigate the negotiation process effectively. The primary actors and their positions relative to HfA, including inclination towards transformative or conservative objectives and their local to global influence, are essential for drafting a strategic negotiation pathway. 

### Stakeholders Identified:

- **HfA (Health for All)**: Protagonist, an international health organization needing to negotiate the safe release of its staff and potentially adjust its departure plans from Iguwafe. Their objectives have shifted globally due to donor preferences, indicating a more conservative approach to local operations in favor of focusing on other regions.
- **Tribal Leaders/Tribesmen**: Counterparty, directly opposing HfA's plans to reallocate resources to Ukraine, detaining staff to prevent hospital closure. They play a pivotal role in local governance and have significant local influence, demonstrating transformative goals to maintain healthcare in their community.
- **Local Hospital Staff and Patients**: Critical local stakeholders affected by HfA's operations and potential closure. Their objectives align with maintaining HfA's presence, reflecting transformative aspirations for local healthcare access.
- **Government of Country Beta**: Has shown restraint and a conservative approach by not intervening directly in the dispute, indicating a more global perspective on the conflict's implications.
- **International Donors (Germany, Switzerland)**: Influencing HfA's strategic direction on a global scale, pushing for a conservative shift of resources away from local engagements in Beta to focus on conflict zones like Ukraine.
- **United Nations and other NGOs (e.g., Food Without Borders, Child Protection International)**: These actors have varying degrees of local to global influence, often supporting transformative objectives focused on immediate community needs while also navigating broader conflicts and humanitarian issues.
- **Local Media and Patient Association**: Represent local voices amplifying concerns over HfA's departure plans and the safety of the detained staff, advocating for transformative measures to secure ongoing healthcare services.

### Creating the Stakeholder Map Script

This script will plot the identified parties according to their objectives (transformative to conservative) and influence (local to global). Note that actual coordinates are hypothetical and should be adjusted based on further analysis:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party (Tribal Leaders)
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Tribal Leaders')  # 'ro' for red circle

# Plot additional parties
# Define coordinates (x, y) for each party based on the analysis
parties = {
    'HfA': (7, 2),
    'Local Hospital Staff': (3, -5),
    'Patients': (4, -4),
    'Government of Country Beta': (5, 5),
    'International Donors': (8, 8),
    'UN & NGOs': (2, 4),
    'Local Media': (-3, -3),
    'Patient Association': (-2, -4)
}
colors = {
    'HfA': 'g',
    'Local Hospital Staff': 'b',
    'Patients': 'b',
    'Government of Country Beta': 'c',
    'International Donors': 'm',
    'UN & NGOs': 'y',
    'Local Media': 'k',
    'Patient Association': 'k'
}

for party, coords in parties.items():
    ax.plot(coords[0], coords[1], 'o', color=colors[party], label=party)

# Adding labels to the points
for party, coords in parties.items():
    ax.annotate(party, (coords[0], coords[1]), textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Show the plot
output_file_path = os.path.join('gpt_responses/plots', f'plot.png')
plt.savefig(output_file_path)
```

This script establishes a visual representation of the negotiation landscape, providing a basis for strategizing negotiation paths. Further consultation with the stakeholders should refine these positions and ensure an accurate depiction of the evolving situation.
