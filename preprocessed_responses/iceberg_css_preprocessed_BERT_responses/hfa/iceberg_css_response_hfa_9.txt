given the multifaceted situation involving the health for all (hfa) organization's negotiation with the tribal leaders in iguwafe for the release of their detained staff, let's break down the positions, reasoning, motives, and values for both parties based on the aspects highlighted: the continuation of healthcare operations, compensation for the families of local guards, and addressing the measles outbreak.

 continuation of healthcare operations

counterparty (tribal leaders) perspective:
- positions: demand for the immediate resumption of hfa's healthcare operations at the local hospital.
- reasoning: recognizes the critical role hfa plays in providing necessary medical services to the local community, especially in the aftermath of conflict and amidst rising healthcare needs.
- motives and values: driven by a commitment to the community's health and well-being, and possibly, leveraging hfa's presence for stability and credibility in tribal leadership.

user’s organization (hfa) perspective:
- motives and values: committed to improving global health and responding to emergencies but needs to allocate resources strategically due to funding constraints and donor directions.
- reasoning: negotiating a phased withdrawal or transitioning services to local providers could mitigate impact while honoring donor commitments.
- positions: propose a gradual scale-down of activities, ensuring transitional arrangements for healthcare services, possibly through training local staff or finding a development ngo to take over.

 compensation for families of local guards

counterparty (tribal leaders) perspective:
- positions: demand compensation for families of local guards who have been killed or injured, ensuring their support.
- reasoning: acknowledges the sacrifice and risks taken by guards to protect hfa facilities and staff, viewing compensation as a rightful claim.
- motives and values: reflects a sense of justice and protection for those who served the community and hfa, upholding social responsibility.

user’s organization (hfa) perspective:
- motives and values: recognizes the value and sacrifice of local guards, adhering to principles of fairness and duty of care.
- reasoning: exploring possibilities to compensate families either directly or through community funds might fulfill moral obligations without setting challenging precedents.
- positions: seek to establish a community fund or direct compensation mechanism for affected families, considering legal and ethical guidelines.

 addressing the measles outbreak

counterparty (tribal leaders) perspective:
- positions: urgent demand for hfa to address the growing measles outbreak among children.
- reasoning: highlights the immediate health threat to the community, emphasizing hfa's capability to manage such outbreaks effectively.
- motives and values: prioritizes children's health and safety, expecting urgent action from hfa due to its medical expertise and resources.

user’s organization (hfa) perspective:
- motives and values: maintaining public health, especially of vulnerable populations like children, aligns with hfa's core mission.
- reasoning: engaging in vaccination campaigns or collaborating with other ngos to tackle the measles outbreak could prevent a health crisis, leveraging hfa's expertise for immediate impact.
- positions: propose launching a targeted vaccination campaign or supporting local health authorities in disease outbreak management as part of the transition strategy.

the next steps for hfa involve using these points as a foundation for meaningful dialogue, considering both sides' values and concerns to reach a mutually beneficial resolution.
