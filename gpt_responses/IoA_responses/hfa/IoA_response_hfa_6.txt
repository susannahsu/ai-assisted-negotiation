Based on the comprehensive background provided and the meetings with various stakeholders, the following Island of Agreement (IoA) table can be constructed:

**Contested Facts:**
- HfA's abrupt decision to leave Iguwafe and its consequences on local healthcare and security.
- The stance that detained HfA staff are hostages versus guests/under house arrest.
- The legitimacy of the demands from tribal leaders and the local community for HfA to continue operations in Iguwafe.
- The effectiveness and morality of ceasing operations in Beta to reallocate resources to Ukraine.
- The responsibility of HfA for compensating the guards' families.

**Agreed Facts:**
- HfA has played a crucial role in providing surgical and medical care in Iguwafe, especially during and after the ethnic clashes.
- The local healthcare infrastructure is insufficient without international NGOs' support.
- The abrupt departure of HfA's Country Director and the limited local consultation have escalated tensions.
- Measles cases are on the rise in the region.
- There is a global pressure on NGOs like HfA to shift resources to areas deemed in more urgent need, like Ukraine.
- The local government and tribal leaders have historically played a significant role in security and order in Iguwafe.

**Convergent Norms:**
- The safety and well-being of HfA staff and local population are paramount.
- Healthcare provision in conflict or post-conflict zones is critical and should continue.
- Acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by local guards and their families.
- The importance of continued dialogue and negotiation to resolve the current crisis.

**Divergent Norms:**
- Perception of HfA's responsibility towards the local healthcare system and its sustainability post-departure.
- The role of international NGOs in development versus emergency response in stable versus conflict zones.
- Appropriate forms of compensation and support for local guards and their families.
- The role and authority of tribal leaders in healthcare and labor disputes.

**Recommendations:**

- **Prioritize:**
  - Establishing a clear, respectful communication channel with tribal leaders to negotiate the safe release of detained staff.
  - Negotiating a transition plan that includes short-term continuation of critical healthcare services, particularly related to measles outbreak and emergency surgeries.
  - Exploring partnerships with organizations like Swisscross for specialized services (e.g., plastic surgery) that HfA cannot provide.
  - Addressing the immediate healthcare needs highlighted by community representatives, offering a compromise towards a phased withdrawal or reduction in service rather than abrupt cessation.
  - Seeking support from entities like FWB to leverage their connections and local rapport.

- **Avoid:**
  - Any actions that could be perceived as disrespecting local norms or bypassing the authority of tribal leaders.
  - Making promises that cannot be realistically fulfilled given the financial and operational constraints facing HfA.
  - Ignoring the grievances and demands of the local community, including those of the guards' families and the patient association.
  - Public confrontations or statements that could escalate tensions further or compromise the safety of detained staff.
  - Assuming that financial incentives or compensations alone will resolve the dispute without addressing the underlying concerns about healthcare continuity and community trust.
