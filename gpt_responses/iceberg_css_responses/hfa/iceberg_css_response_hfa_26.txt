Based on the provided case about Health for All (HfA) and the complex situation in Iguwafe, the negotiation takes on multifaceted challenges. Below, we detail the positions, reasoning, and motives/values for both HfA and the Tribal Leaders counterparty, focusing on three key aspects: the abrupt operational shift of HfA, security and well-being of the detained staff, and future healthcare provisions in Iguwafe.

### Future Healthcare Provisions in Iguwafe
