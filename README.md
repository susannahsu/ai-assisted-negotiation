# ai-assited-negotiation
This repo is for testing the Spring 2024 AC297r Capstone Project 1: AI-assisted negotiation tool. The Project is presented in conjunction with Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Frontline Negotiations. 

Before you start, please make sure that you have all the dependencies set up properly. You can run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
which will help you install all the listed packages needed for running scripts in this repo.


To run the simulations in batches using the scripts, you will need an OpenAI API key. Start by creating a file named `.env` in the root directory. Then type the following
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=___
```
If you are involved in our project, please contact me directly for the project-specific API key. Please do not use this API key for other purposes since we only have $100 budget provided.
