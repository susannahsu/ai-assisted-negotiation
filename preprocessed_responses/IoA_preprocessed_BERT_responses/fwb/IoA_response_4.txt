based on the information provided, here are the key aspects of the negotiation between food without borders (fwb) and the camp authorities, categorized as per the island of agreement (ioa) framework:

 contested facts:
- effectiveness of current camp nutritional data: camp commander considers existing data sufficient while fwb insists on conducting a new nutritional assessment.
- necessity for guards in food distribution roles: the camp authorities demand the participation of local guards in food distribution, which fwb opposes due to principles of neutrality and risk of aid diversion.
- compensation form for local guards: camp authorities insist on in-kind food compensation; fwb prefers cash payments to prevent food aid diversion.
- security concerns justifying guard presence: fwb seeks to operate without local guard oversight; however, the camp authorities and camp commander see this as a security risk.

 agreed facts:
- urgent need for food aid among refugees: both fwb and camp authorities acknowledge the severe food insecurity and the necessity of rapid food aid distribution.
- significance of engaging the local community in distribution processes: while the desired approach differs, both parties recognize the importance of community engagement in aid distribution.

 convergent norms:
- priority of aiding vulnerable populations: both parties aim to support populations in severe need, despite differences in operational strategies.
- acknowledgment of refugee suffering: there's a shared understanding of the refugees' dire situation, even though the perception of how to address it varies.

 divergent norms:
- neutrality and independence in providing aid: fwb upholds these principles, whereas the camp authorities’ demands potentially compromise them.
- compensation practices: fwb and camp authorities diverge on acceptable forms of compensation for security personnel assisting in food distribution.
- security measures and freedom of operation: fwb advocates for the freedom of its personnel to operate within the camp; the camp authorities are insistent on security oversight through local guards.

 recommendations on what to prioritize and what to avoid in the negotiation:

 prioritize:
- engagement with third parties for oversight: enlist neutral, internationally respected entities to oversee food distribution, ensuring fgwb's principles of neutrality are maintained.
- technical assessment negotiation: press for a compromise allowing a swift, fwb-led nutritional assessment that aligns with donor requirements and aims at an objective understanding of needs.
- alternative security arrangements: propose an alternative, reputable security solution that doesn’t involve local militia members but ensures the safety of fwb staff and food aid.
- direct benefits to the refugee population: ensure negotiations focus on mechanisms that directly benefit refugees and limit potential aid diversion.

 avoid:
- compromising on core principles: refrain from agreements that would undermine fwb’s principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.
- in-kind compensation to local guards: avoid setting precedents that could lead to food aid diversion. explore alternative compensations that don’t involve diverting food from refugees.
- public confrontation: maintain a diplomatic approach that seeks to build bridges rather than publicly challenge the camp authorities, which could exacerbate tensions and jeopardize aid delivery.
