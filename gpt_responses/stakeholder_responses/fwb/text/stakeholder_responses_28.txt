Based on the provided information, we will construct a stakeholder map for the FWB negotiation scenario involving food aid distribution in a refugee camp in Country Alpha. The key parties include:

- **FWB (Food Without Borders)**: Protagonist, an international humanitarian organization.
- **Camp Authorities (Local Guards and Camp Commander)**: Counterparty, overseeing security and operations within the refugee camp.

Other significant stakeholders identified are:
- **The UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Alpha**: Concerned with the overall welfare of refugees.
- **Health for All**: An NGO providing healthcare services within the camp.
- **MASHA**: A local NGO reporting on conditions within the camp and the behavior of camp guards.
- **Refugee Leaders**: Representatives of the refugee population.
- **The German Government**: A significant donor to FWB with specific requirements for food aid distribution.
- **The Mayor of the local village**: Discusses the local economy and its dependence on the camp.
- **The Minister of Defense of Alpha**: Offers a governmental perspective on refugees and operational constraints for NGOs.
- **The Council of Omega Abroad**: Represents the interests of Omega's diaspora, advocating for the refugees.
- **Local Press**: Influences public opinion regarding refugees and the camp.
- **Local Church Activists**: Highlight issues within the community and camp related to militia behavior.
- **Leaders of the Militia**: Express their views on the entitlement of guards to aid.
- **Leaders of the Local Guards**: Demand food items for themselves and their families.

We'll place these stakeholders on a map according to their inclination towards change (transformative to conservative) and their local to global influence. For the purpose of this initial visualization, positions are approximated based on the stakeholder roles and interests discussed:

- **Camp Authorities** are at the center (0,0), marked as the counterparty.
- **FWB** will be plotted with an inclination towards change due to its mission for humanitarian aid, with a moderate to high global influence.
- Others will be plotted based on their roles, influence levels, and inclinations towards either maintaining the status quo or supporting transformative actions for the refugee situation.

Let's proceed with generating the Python `matplotlib` script to visualize this stakeholder map.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map for FWB Negotiation')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Camp Authorities')  # 'ro' for red circle

# Plot other stakeholders based on details
# Protagonist (FWB)
ax.plot(4, 7, 'go', label='FWB')  # 'go' for green circle

# Other significant stakeholders
ax.plot(-3, 5, 'bo', label='UN Humanitarian Coordinator')
ax.plot(1, 3, 'co', label='Health for All')  # 'co' for cyan circle
ax.plot(-1, 2, 'mo', label='MASHA')  # 'mo' for magenta circle
ax.plot(2, -2, 'yo', label='Refugee Leaders')  # 'yo' for yellow circle
ax.plot(3, 8, 'ko', label='German Government')  # 'ko' for black circle
ax.plot(-2, -1, 'bo', label='Mayor of Local Village')
ax.plot(-4, 6, 'ko', label='Minister of Defense of Alpha')
ax.plot(4, -3, 'mo', label='Council of Omega Abroad')
ax.plot(0, -4, 'yo', label='Local Press')
ax.plot(-5, 0, 'co', label='Local Church Activists')
ax.plot(5, 0, 'mo', label='Leaders of the Militia')
ax.plot(5, -2, 'ro', label='Leaders of Local Guards')

# Adding labels to the points
labels = ['Camp Authorities', 'FWB', 'UN Humanitarian Coordinator', 'Health for All', 'MASHA', 'Refugee Leaders',
          'German Government', 'Mayor of Local Village', 'Minister of Defense of Alpha', 'Council of Omega Abroad',
          'Local Press', 'Local Church Activists', 'Leaders of the Militia', 'Leaders of Local Guards']

# Positions for labels (same order as labels)
x_positions = [0, 4, -3, 1, -1, 2, 3, -2, -4, 4, 0, -5, 5, 5]
y_positions = [0, 7, 5, 3, 2, -2, 8, -1, 6, -3, -4, 0, 0, -2]

for i, txt in enumerate(labels):
    ax.annotate(txt, (x_positions[i], y_positions[i]), textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Show the plot (For this script, we'll assume a save path and not include the run_number variable for simplicity)
output_file_path = os.path.join('gpt_responses/plots', 'stakeholder_map_fwb_case.png')
plt.savefig(output_file_path)
```

This code will plot the initial stakeholder map for the FWB negotiation scenario, providing a visual starting point for analyzing relationships and developing negotiation strategies. Adjustments may be needed based on further details or shifts in stakeholder positions and interests.
