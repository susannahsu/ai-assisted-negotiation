Based on the provided information, here's the Island of Agreement (IoA) table analysis and negotiation strategies for Health for All (HfA) regarding the situation in Iguwafe, Country Beta:

**Island of Agreement Table**

- **Contested Facts:**
  - The necessity and manner of HfA's departure from Iguwafe and shifting focus to Ukraine.
  - The responsibility and future contributions to compensate the local guards' families.
  - The extent to which local health services, including the hospital's operations, can continue without HfA's presence.
  - The interpretation of the international staff's "house arrest" situation â€” whether as hostages or guests.

- **Agreed Facts:**
  - HfA played a critical role in providing health services in Iguwafe, especially surgical care.
  - The local population depends heavily on the hospital for healthcare services, including emergency and reconstructive surgery.
  - The departure of HfA has left a significant void in healthcare provision in the district.
  - There is a high burden of infectious diseases, including measles, which poses a threat to the population.

- **Convergent Norms:**
  - The safety and well-being of HfA's international staff is a paramount concern.
  - The importance of ensuring continuous healthcare services to the Iguwafe population.
  - Acknowledgment from both HfA and local tribal leaders about the necessity of collaborative dialogue to resolve the situation.
  - Mutual understanding of the significant role local guards played during the conflict period.

- **Divergent Norms:**
  - Views on the immediate and long-term healthcare strategy for Iguwafe, including the mode of execution and the entities responsible for it.
  - Perspectives on HfA's operational priorities and ethical responsibilities towards the Iguwafe community and its employees versus the need to redirect resources to Ukraine.
  - Approaches towards compensating the families of the deceased or disabled local guards.

**Recommendations**

- **Prioritize:**
  - Ensuring the immediate and unconditional safety of HfA's detained staff.
  - Establishing a temporary plan to maintain essential health services in Iguwafe, emphasizing immediate healthcare needs (e.g., surgical interventions, measles outbreak response).
  - Opening a communication channel for negotiation that includes, if necessary, mediators like the UN to ensure a culturally sensitive and respectful dialogue.
  - Constructing a detailed transition plan, possibly involving other NGOs, to ensure long-term healthcare provision in Iguwafe and addressing the compensation for local guards' families.

- **Avoid:**
  - Making any commitments HfA cannot fulfill due to operational constraints or donor requirements.
  - Underestimating the local cultural nuances and political dynamics, particularly the influence and expectations of tribal leaders.
  - Ignoring the broader implications of their conflict with the tribesmen, especially the potential for it to evolve into a more severe hostage situation.
  - Overlooking the critical feedback from various stakeholders, including the Beta government, UN agencies, other NGOs, and the local community, about the abruptness and implications of HfA's departure. 

Maintaining a flexible yet strategic stance will be crucial for HfA to navigate this complex situation. Collaboration, transparency, and respect for local norms and expectations will be key in finding a mutually acceptable solution.
