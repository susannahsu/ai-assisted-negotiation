### Strategy for Negotiation:

The negotiation strategy needs to emphasize common ground and shared values—primarily, the health and well-being of the Iguwafe community. HfA should clearly communicate its constraints and desire for a responsible transition of services, aiming for solutions that respect the local community's needs and those of HfA's global mission. Establishing a clear timeline, engaging local and international stakeholders for support, and framing negotiations around mutual benefits and shared responsibilities will be crucial for a successful outcome.
