given the complexities of the negotiations between health for all (hfa) and the tribal leaders in iguwafe, here is a structured analysis based on the iceberg and common shared space (css) models focusing on three critical aspects: the detention of hfa staff, the closure of hfa operations and its consequences, and the demands for supporting the hospital's guards and addressing the measles outbreak.
