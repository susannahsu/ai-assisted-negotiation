### Recommendations

#### Prioritize:
- Establishing a clear, shared understanding of the immediate healthcare needs in Iguwafe and how they can be addressed, including measles outbreaks and surgeries.
- Building trust and a respectful dialogue with tribal leaders, emphasizing shared values around community health and safety.
- Developing a transparent, phased plan for transitioning HfA's operations that includes input from local stakeholders to ensure continuity of care.
- Exploring partnerships with other NGOs (e.g., CPI, FWB) and local authorities to sustain essential health services, including vaccination campaigns and basic surgical care.

#### Avoid:
- Public or private statements that might inflame tensions or create further misunderstandings about HfA's intentions and capabilities.
- Overlooking or minimizing the importance of compensating and supporting the families of local guards who have been affected by violence, as this is a potent symbol of HfA's commitment to the community.
- Making any commitments or promises that HfA cannot realistically fulfill, given funding constraints and other organizational priorities.
- Underestimating the complexity of local politics and the influence of tribal leaders; ensuring all negotiations are conducted with sensitivity to local norms and respect for all involved.
