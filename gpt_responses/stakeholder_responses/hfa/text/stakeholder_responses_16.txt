Based on the extensive information provided, the stakeholder map for the situation involving Health for All (HfA) in Iguwafe, Country Beta, is outlined below. This map will illustrate the diverse group of stakeholders involved in the negotiation over HfA's continued presence and operation within the region.

- **Primary Party (Protagonist)**: Health for All (HfA)
- **Counterparty**: Local Armed Tribesmen

**Other Key Stakeholders**:
1. **Tribal Leaders**
2. **The Government of Country Beta**
3. **The Local Hospital Staff**
4. **The Swiss and German Governments (Main Donors)**
5. **UN Representatives**
6. **International Staff of HfA**
7. **Local Police and Army**
8. **Patient Association of Iguwafe**
9. **Food Without Borders (FWB)**
10. **Child Protection International (CPI)**
11. **Representatives of the Local Guards and Their Families**

The positions on the map will consider stakeholders' inclination towards change (transformational to conservative objective) and their influence (local to global identity). Given the dynamics, a brief justification for positioning is as follows:

- The **Tribal Leaders** and **Local Armed Tribesmen** stand opposed to the closure, making them central to the negotiation but with a strong local influence.
- **HfA** wants to redirect its resources, influenced globally (seeking transformative change but now in a mediation position).
- **The Government of Country Beta** might be inclined towards finding a sustainable healthcare solution but is constrained by resources and political leverage.
- **The Local Hospital Staff** and **Patient Association** are significantly impacted by HfA's actions and are local in influence, seeking to conserve the existing healthcare services.
- **Donor Governments** possess global influence and are inclined towards transformative objectives, redirected toward other crisis regions.
- **UN Representatives** hold a global influence, seeking to mediate the situation while promoting the safe continuation of humanitarian work.
- **International Staff of HfA** are directly impacted and central to negotiations but lack the power to influence outcomes significantly.
- **Local Police and Army** are limited in influence by the tribal dynamics but have a stake in maintaining order.
- **FWB** and **CPI** share similar positions as HfA but may differ in operational priorities and influence levels.

Let's create a preliminary script to generate the visualization for this scenario. This script will serve as a basis and might need adjustments based on further inputs or clarification:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map for HfA Negotiation in Iguwafe')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party (Local Armed Tribesmen at 0,0)
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Local Armed Tribesmen')

# Add other stakeholders
positions = {
    'HfA': (2, 7),
    'Tribal Leaders': (-5, 1),
    'Government of Country Beta': (0, 3),
    'Local Hospital Staff': (-4, -2),
    'Swiss and German Governments': (6, 7),
    'UN Representatives': (5, 6),
    'International Staff of HfA': (1, -1),
    'Local Police and Army': (-1, -4),
    'Patient Association of Iguwafe': (-3, -3),
    'Food Without Borders': (4, 5),
    'Child Protection International': (4, 4),
    'Local Guards and Families': (-3, -2),
}

# Plotting other parties
for label, (x, y) in positions.items():
    ax.plot(x, y, 'bo')  # 'bo' for blue circle
    ax.annotate(label, (x, y), textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Show the plot
output_file_path = os.path.join('gpt_responses/plots', 'hfa_stakeholder_map.png')
plt.savefig(output_file_path)
plt.show()
```

This script generates a stakeholder map based on the provided information. Remember, the positioning might require adjustments for accuracy based on further analysis or user feedback.
