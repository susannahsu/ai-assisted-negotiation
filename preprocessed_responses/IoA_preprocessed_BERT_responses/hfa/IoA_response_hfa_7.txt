- contested facts:
    [NUMBER]. hfa's abrupt decision to depart from iguwafe without sufficient local consultation.
    [NUMBER]. the intended closure of hfa’s operations is seen as a labor dispute by hfa but as extortion/hostage situation by the tribesmen.

    [NUMBER]. healthcare infrastructure in beta, including iguwafe, is severely compromised, underscoring the importance of hfa's services.
    [NUMBER]. the local population is currently facing an increase in measles cases, with a lack of alternative healthcare services.

    [NUMBER]. the necessity and extent of hfa's continued operations in iguwafe.
    [NUMBER]. the perceived obligations of hfa to the community versus its global mission priorities.

recommendations for negotiation strategy:

- prioritize:
    [NUMBER]. confirming the immediate security and safety of the hfa staff.
    [NUMBER]. establishing a phased transition plan for hfa's services in iguwafe to local or government healthcare providers.
    [NUMBER]. demonstrating a commitment to addressing the measles outbreak as an immediate healthcare priority.
    [NUMBER]. opening a dialogue for compensation for the families of deceased or injured local guards within a defined legal framework.
    [NUMBER]. exploring opportunities for collaboration with other ngos or governmental bodies to ensure continuity of essential services at the hospital.

- avoid:
    [NUMBER]. any actions or communications that could be perceived as undermining the authority or concerns of the tribal leaders and local guards.
    [NUMBER]. making promises beyond hfa's capacity to deliver, to prevent false expectations.
    [NUMBER]. dismissing the importance of local customs, including the process for negotiating with tribal leaders.

this structured approach aims at not only securing the release of the detained staff but also at ensuring that hfa's transition out of iguwafe does not compromise the community's access to essential healthcare services.
