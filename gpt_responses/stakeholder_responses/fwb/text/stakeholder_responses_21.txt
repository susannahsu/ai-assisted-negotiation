This script plots a stakeholder map based on the roles and positions of various parties involved in the negotiation involving Food Without Borders (FWB) planning the distribution of food aid in a refugee camp in Country Alpha. Each stakeholder is positioned based on their inclination towards change (transformative to conservative on the X-axis) and their level of influence from local to global (Y-axis). The camp authorities, being the counterparty with interests most opposing those of FWB, are placed at the origin, marked in red. Other stakeholders are plotted according to the information provided, with attempts to represent their relative positions regarding their objectives and influence.
