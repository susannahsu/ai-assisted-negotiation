**Aspect 1: Employment and Compensation of Local Guards for Food Distribution**

- **Counterparty (Camp Authorities) Position:**
    - Positions (What): Insist that FWB hires local guards for food distribution and compensates them with food rations.
    - Reasoning (How): Argue that guards' roles in distribution extend beyond security, likening them to day laborers deserving of compensation, particularly in food rations given the regional economic context.
    - Motives and Values (Why): Aim to secure resources for guards and their families, who are also experiencing food insecurity; maintain control over camp operations and economic ecosystem within the camp.
    
- **User’s Organization (FWB) Motives and Values:**
    - Motives and Values (Why): Committed to impartially providing emergency food aid, ensuring aid reaches intended beneficiaries without diversion.
    - Reasoning (How): Believes hiring guards affiliated with militias could compromise neutrality and aid diversion, against donor stipulations and organizational principles.
    - Positions (What): Proposes hiring and vetting labor from local community, not affiliated with the militia, and insists on cash compensation to prevent aid diversion.

**Aspect 2: Conducting a Nutritional Assessment**

- **Counterparty (Camp Authorities) Position:**
    - Positions (What): Deems existing nutritional status data collected by Camp Administration sufficient, urging FWB to bypass a new assessment and begin immediate distribution.
    - Reasoning (How): Emphasizes the urgency of food distribution to alleviate refugee hardship.
    - Motives and Values (Why): Likely aims to streamline the distribution process to quell unrest and maintain the status quo, which benefits the camp's overseers.

- **User's Organization (FWB) Motives and Values:**
    - Motives and Values (Why): Committed to ensuring that food aid reaches those in dire need, in line with donors' requirements for accountability.
    - Reasoning (How): Argues that an updated, thorough nutritional assessment is essential for tailored, effective food aid distribution.
    - Positions (What): Seeks to conduct a new nutritional assessment despite camp authorities' opposition to accurately target aid.

**Aspect 3: Freedom of Movement Within the Camp**

- **Counterparty (Camp Authorities) Position:**
    - Positions (What): Requires that guards always accompany FWB representatives within the camp, citing security concerns.
    - Reasoning (How): Maintaining control over camp operations and interactions between FWB and refugees.
    - Motives and Values (Why): Aim to safeguard their authority and oversight, preventing any undermining of their control or potential accountability.

- **User’s Organization (FWB) Motives and Values:**

    - Reasoning (How): Believes unaccompanied access is crucial for establishing trust with refugees, accurately assessing needs, and ensuring aid efficiency.

Through these aspects and the associated positions, reasoning, and motives/values, it's apparent that the negotiation between FWB and the camp authorities revolves around balancing the urgency of humanitarian aid with maintaining FWB’s principles against the backdrop of complex local dynamics.
