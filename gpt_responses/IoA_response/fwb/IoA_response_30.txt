**Island of Agreement (IoA) Table for FWB and Camp Authorities Negotiation**

- **Contested Facts:**
  1. Necessity of hiring local guards for food ration distribution.
  2. The requirement for direct food ration compensation to guards and their families.
  3. The adequacy of the camp administration’s existing nutritional status data.
  4. The effectiveness of FWB’s proposed direct cash payments in the local economic context.
  5. FWB's policy against in-kind food payments and its implications on local guards' compensation.

- **Agreed Facts:**
  1. Over 160,000 refugees settled in the primary camp, facing severe nutritional deficiencies.
  2. Continuous influx of refugees, predominantly children and women.
  3. Camp conditions include inadequate shelter, access to clean water, and limited healthcare services.
  4. The camp is under strict control with instances of extortion and violence from the guards.
  5. FWB aims to provide emergency food rations to recently arrived refugee families.
  6. There is an urgent need for food aid in the camp, as identified by various sources.

- **Convergent Norms:**
  1. Recognition of the urgent humanitarian need for food assistance in the refugee camp.
  2. Acknowledgment of the critical role of FWB in providing this assistance.
  3. Agreement on the importance of ensuring food aid reaches the intended beneficiaries (refugees).
  4. Shared understanding of the necessity of a secure and orderly distribution process.

- **Divergent Norms:**
  1. FWB’s insistence on neutrality, impartiality, and independence vs. the camp authority's requirement for local guard involvement.
  2. Perspective on who qualifies for food aid compensation (guards vs. refugees).
  3. Views on the optimal mechanism for compensation (food rations vs. cash).
  4. Definitions of security requirements within the camp during the food distribution process.

**Recommendations for Negotiation Strategy:**

- **Prioritize:**
  1. Establishing a collaboration model that respects FWB's neutrality while acknowledging the camp authority's security concerns.
  2. Securing an agreement to conduct an updated, comprehensive nutritional assessment to ensure aid is directed to those in the most critical need.
  3. Exploring alternative compensation strategies for guards that align with FWB policies, such as involving third parties to provide compensation or seeking exceptions to certain policies under emergency conditions.
  4. Guaranteeing FWB the ability to vet any personnel involved in the distribution process to prevent diversion of aid.

- **Avoid:**
  1. Compromising FWB’s principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.
  2. Agreeing to direct food rations compensation to guards without exploring all possible alternatives.
  3. Ignoring the concerns of the refugee population regarding the involvement of local guards.
  4. Disregarding the detailed nutritional needs analysis for effective targeting of food aid.
