Based on the detailed background and information provided, here is the Island of Agreement (IoA) table populated with the critical items for the negotiation environment involving FWB and the camp authorities:

**Contested Facts:**
- The necessity and scope of FWB conducting its nutritional assessment versus using existing data from the Camp Administration.
- The requirement by the camp authorities for FWB to hire local guards for food distribution.
- The method of compensation for local guards (food rations vs. FWB's policy of cash payments).
- The estimated number of daily laborers required for food distribution and their potential affiliations (200 as estimated by the Camp Administrator predominantly consisting of guards and their relatives).

**Agreed Facts:**
- Over 160,000 refugees are housed in the primary camp, facing severe nutritional deficiencies.
- The refugees are primarily women and children.
- The refugees are restricted within the camp boundaries, requiring permission to leave.
- The camp is overseen by authorities with links to armed militias, resulting in occasional violence against refugees.
- FWB is dedicated to providing emergency food assistance impartially and swiftly to those in need.

**Convergent Norms:**
- Both parties recognize the urgent need for food assistance among the refugee population.
- The importance of ensuring food aid reaches the intended beneficiaries without diversion.
- Acknowledgment of the critical role FWB plays in providing humanitarian assistance.

**Divergent Norms:**
- FWB's principle of neutrality, impartiality, and independence versus the camp authorities' insistence on the involvement of local guards in the distribution process.
- The approach to compensating those who assist in the food distribution (in-kind vs. cash payments).
- FWB's requirement for the freedom of movement for its staff within the camp contrasting with the Camp Commander's insistence on guard accompaniment for security reasons.

**Recommendations**

**Prioritize:**
- Establishing a common understanding with the camp authorities about FWB’s mission and the non-negotiable nature of its principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.
- Negotiating the feasibility of conducting a quick, streamlined FWB-led nutritional assessment to identify the most vulnerable refugees and satisfy donor requirements.
- Exploring third-party oversight or collaboration with other NGOs to ensure transparency and accountability in food distribution.
- Identifying alternative compensation methods for guards/local labor that align with FWB’s policies but also address the guards’ claims of food insecurity.

**Avoid:**
- Conceding to demands that compromise FWB’s principles, such as mandatory hiring of local guards with affiliations to the conflict.
- Delays in initiating the food aid distribution due to prolonged negotiations that would exacerbate the refugees' suffering.
- Publicly contesting the camp authorities' perspectives without first attempting to resolve differences through dialogue, to avoid escalating tensions.
- Any agreements that might implicitly support or legitimize the actions of the local militias against the refugees or the exploitation of the refugee population.
