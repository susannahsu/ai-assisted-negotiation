Based on the detailed background and additional notes provided, let's proceed to the stakeholder mapping visualization preparation. The scenario involves various stakeholders contributing to the complex negotiation landscape surrounding Food Without Borders (FWB) efforts to distribute food aid to refugees in Alpha.

### Stakeholders Identified:
1. **Protagonist (Primary Party):** FWB
2. **Counterparty:** Camp authorities (Camp Commander and Administrative Body)
3. **Other Key Stakeholders:**
    - Local Guards/Militia
    - The UN Humanitarian Coordinator
    - The German government (as a donor)
    - Health for All NGO
    - MASHA (Local NGO)
    - The Mayor of the local village
    - The Minister of Defense of Alpha
    - The Council of Omega Abroad
    - Local press
    - Local church activists
    - Refugee Leaders

### Stakeholder Positions:
- **FWB** is tasked with navigating the complex dynamics within the camp to ensure efficient food distribution while maintaining its core principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.
- **Camp authorities** are imposing restrictions on FWB, requiring local guard involvement in food distribution and insisting on in-kind (food) payment to guards.
- **Local guards/militia** are implicated in controlling the refugee population, often engaging in exploitative and violent behaviors. They are demanding food rations for themselves and their families in exchange for cooperation.
- **Refugee leaders** are opposed to the involvement of local guards in humanitarian efforts due to past abuses and insist on more accountability from international organizations.

### Visualization Preparation:
Given the context, we will plot the stakeholders based on their inclination towards change (transformative to conservative) and their influence (local to global).

- **FWB** would likely be positioned towards transformative change, given its mission to provide aid and restore dignity.
- **Camp authorities**, being conservative, resisting FWB's operational independence, will be placed at the origin (0,0) in red, signifying their opposition to FWB.
- **Other stakeholders** will be plotted based on their support for or resistance against the protagonist's objectives and their influence level.

### Python Script for Stakeholder Map:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Camp Authorities - Counter Party')  # 'ro' for red circle

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Example coordinates for FWB
x_FWB = -8  # Example x-coordinate for FWB, indicating a transformative inclination
y_FWB = 5   # Example y-coordinate for FWB, indicating global influence
ax.plot(x_FWB, y_FWB, 'go', label='FWB (User Party)')  # 'go' for green circle

# Adding labels to the points
ax.annotate('Camp Authorities', (0, 0), textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')
ax.annotate('FWB', (x_FWB, y_FWB), textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```
This script outlines the initial positions of FWB and the camp authorities on the stakeholder map. Adjustments and the addition of other stakeholders may follow based on further analysis or user feedback.
