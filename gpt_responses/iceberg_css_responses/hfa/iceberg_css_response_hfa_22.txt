## Negotiation Analysis

### Aspect 1: Continuation of HfA's Operations in Iguwafe

- **Counterparty (Tribal Leaders):**
  - **Positions:** Demand HfA to continue its medical services in Iguwafe, restart hospital operations, compensate the families of local guards, and assist in controlling the measles outbreak.
  - **Reasoning:** The abrupt departure of HfA could result in a healthcare vacuum in Iguwafe, exacerbating public health crises and potentially causing social unrest given the already tense situation.

An understanding that continuing operations could appease tribal leaders and ensure staff safety, alongside recognition of the critical healthcare role HfA plays in the local community.

### Aspect 3: Addressing the Measles Outbreak and Continuing Healthcare Provision

  - **Reasoning:** The sudden gap in healthcare provision due to HfA's proposed departure exacerbates public health issues, with the measles outbreak posing an immediate threat to community health.
  - **Motives and Values:** Protection of public health, particularly of vulnerable populations like children, and sustaining the community's access to essential healthcare services.

- **User’s Organization (HfA):**
  - **Motives and Values:** A duty to prevent and mitigate public health crises, uphold the principles of humanitarian aid, and maintain the well-being of communities they serve.
  - **Reasoning:** Addressing the measles outbreak and ensuring a smooth transition of medical services to local authorities or another NGO could mitigate the crisis and support HfA’s safe exit strategy.
