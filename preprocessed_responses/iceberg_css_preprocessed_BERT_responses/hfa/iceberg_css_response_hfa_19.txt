based on the extensive background provided and the detailed accounts of meetings and perspectives from various stakeholders involved in the situation concerning health for all (hfa) and the tribal leaders in iguwafe, it's crucial to distill and organize the key aspects of the negotiation within the framework of the iceberg and common shared space (css) models. given the complexity of this scenario, we'll focus on three critical aspects: the continuation of hfa’s operations in iguwafe, compensation for the local guards' families, and addressing the measles outbreak. 

aspect [NUMBER]: continuation of hfa's operations in iguwafe

counterparty (tribal leaders):
- positions (what): demand the resumption of operations by hfa in iguwafe.
- reasoning (how): the sudden closure threatens the community's healthcare system, leaving patients without necessary care.
- motives and values (why): value community well-being and stability; want to maintain the healthcare services that have become a staple of the community.

user’s organization (hfa):
- motives and values (why): committed to providing healthcare in conflict-stricken areas but facing donor pressure to reallocate resources.
- reasoning (how): the decision to leave is driven by strategic reallocation of resources, not a lack of commitment to the beta population.
- positions (what): would prefer to transition healthcare responsibilities to a local entity, acknowledging the current impossibility of continuing their operations in iguwafe in the long term.

aspect [NUMBER]: compensation for the local guards' families

counterparty (tribal leaders and local guards' representatives):
- positions (what): request financial compensation for the families of local guards who have suffered or died.
- reasoning (how): these guards played a crucial role in maintaining the security and operational capability of hfa under challenging conditions.
- motives and values (why): driven by a sense of justice and the value of acknowledging sacrifices made for the greater good of the community.

user’s organization (hfa):
- motives and values (why): recognizes the sacrifices made by the local guards but is constrained by policies and resources.
- reasoning (how): need to navigate the organization's protocols and funding limitations while trying to address the grievances raised.
- positions (what): open to discussing compensation but must consider organizational limitations and the broader implications of setting such a precedent.

aspect [NUMBER]: addressing the measles outbreak

counterparty (tribal leaders and patient association):
- positions (what): urgently request hfa’s involvement in controlling the measles outbreak.
- reasoning (how): view hfa as uniquely capable of responding effectively based on their previous healthcare contributions.
- motives and values (why): concern for the health and well-being of their community, especially the vulnerable children's population.

user’s organization (hfa):
- motives and values (why): health and wellbeing of populations in crisis areas are core to hfa’s mission.
- reasoning (how): understands the critical need for immediate healthcare interventions in outbreak situations.
- positions (what): willing to take measures to address the measles outbreak, likely including vaccinations and public health campaigns, within the limitations of current resources and commitments to transition operations.

the detailed organization of each party's position, reasoning, and underlying motives/values for these three aspects sets the stage for identifying common ground and possible areas for negotiation. recognizing the tensions between hfa’s operational limitations and strategic shifts and the immediate healthcare needs and expectations of the iguwafe community lays the foundation for developing a negotiation strategy focused on common shared space and mutual interests.
