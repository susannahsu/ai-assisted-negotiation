Based on the comprehensive background provided, here is the Island of Agreement (IoA) table for the negotiation situation between Health for All (HfA) and the local tribal leaders in Iguwafe:

### Contested Facts:
- The feasibility and scope of HfA's continued operations in Iguwafe in light of funding constraints and the redirection of resources to Ukraine.
- The impact of HfA's departure on the local healthcare infrastructure, particularly in terms of surgical and measles outbreak response capabilities.
- Responsibility for the compensation of the local guards' families who suffered during the conflict.
- The characterization of the HfA staff's detention situation (labor dispute vs. hostage situation).

### Agreed Facts:
- The invaluable role of HfA in addressing the healthcare needs of the Iguwafe community, especially during the ethnic conflicts.
- The critical healthcare challenges in Iguwafe, including measles outbreaks and the absence of other surgical care providers.
- The essential need for the safe release and well-being of the detained HfA staff.
- The lack of governmental ability to immediately fill the void left by HfA's potential exit.

### Convergent Norms:
- The shared understanding of the importance of maintaining healthcare services in Iguwafe, especially for the vulnerable population.
- The mutual respect for the sacrifices made by local guards and their families during the ethnic clashes.
- Acknowledgment of the international community's role, represented by NGOs like HfA, in supporting conflict-affected regions.
- The collective interest in ensuring the safety and security of humanitarian staff working in volatile regions.

### Divergent Norms:
- Perspectives on the obligations of HfA towards the local community and healthcare infrastructure once its primary mission concludes.
- Views on the extent of compensation and support owed to the families of local guards who suffered during the conflict.
- Understanding of the local vs. international priorities in crises response, particularly the balance between immediate local needs vs. global crises like the situation in Ukraine.

### Recommendations for the Negotiation:

#### Prioritize:
- Establishment of a clear, mutual understanding regarding the critical healthcare needs of Iguwafe and HfA's ability to meet these needs amid funding constraints.
- Seeking a compromise that allows for a temporary continuance of essential health services until a suitable handover can be arranged to local health authorities or other NGOs.
- Addressing the compensation claims of the local guards' families to acknowledge their contributions and sacrifices.
- Ensuring the immediate safety and planned release of the detained HfA staff through goodwill gestures and constructive dialogue.

#### Avoid:
- Discussions that may escalate tensions or give an impression of disrespect towards the tribal leaders' authority or concerns.
- Making commitments that HfA cannot feasibly honor in the long term, to avoid future disputes and mistrust.
- Public or external pressures that could embarrass the tribal leaders or undermine their standing within the community.
- Any actions or statements that could be perceived as bypassing the established dialogue channels with the tribal leadership.
