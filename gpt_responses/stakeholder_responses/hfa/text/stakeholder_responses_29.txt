Given the complexity of the situation involving Health for All (HfA) in Iguwafe, the negotiation landscape is densely populated with stakeholders each bearing unique interests and influences. To navigate this scenario efficiently, a stakeholder mapping visualization is imperative. This visualization will elucidate the dynamics at play and assist HfA in strategizing their negotiation paths effectively.

### Stakeholder Mapping

To properly visualize this information, we will plot stakeholders based on their inclination towards change (from transformative to conservative concerning HfA's operations shifting focus away from Iguwafe) and their influence (from local to global).

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counterparty
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Armed Tribesmen')  # 'ro' for red circle

# Stakeholders coordinates and labels
stakeholders = {
    'HfA': (5, 8),
    'Tribal Leaders': (3, 3),
    'Government of Country Beta': (-4, 5),
    'Local Hospital Staff and Community': (2, 1),
    'German and Swiss Donors': (7, 10),
    'UN Representatives': (-3, 7),
    'FWB': (0, 4),
    'German and Swiss Ambassadors': (6, 9),
    'CPI': (-2, 2),
    'Local Press': (-1, 1),
    'Local Police and Administration': (1, 5),
    'Patient Association of Iguwafe': (2, 2),
    'HfA\'s Surgical Team in Iguwafe': (3, 0),
    'Local Guards and their Families': (2, -1)
}

# Plot each stakeholder
for label, coord in stakeholders.items():
    ax.plot(coord[0], coord[1], 'bo')  # 'bo' for blue circle
    ax.annotate(label, coord, textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Show the plot
plt.show()

This script plots a stakeholder map highlighting the various parties involved in HfA's negotiation context in Iguwafe. Armed Tribesmen, as the counterparty, are centrally placed, with other stakeholders positioned based on their stance and influence over the situation.
