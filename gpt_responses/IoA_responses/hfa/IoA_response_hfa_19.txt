Based on the detailed situation described above, the Island of Agreement (IoA) table for the negotiation between Health for All (HfA) representatives and various stakeholders (including tribal leaders, local authorities, and families of the affected local guards and hospital staff) is outlined as follows:

### Contested Facts:
- HfA's decision to leave Iguwafe is perceived as sudden and without adequate local consultation.
- The nature of the detention of HfA staff (labour dispute vs. hostage situation).
- The level of safety and treatment of HfA staff under house arrest.
- HfA's obligation to the guards who were harmed or killed and their families.
- The feasibility of HfA continuing operations in Iguwafe.

### Agreed Facts:
- HfA has been a critical healthcare provider in Iguwafe amid challenging conditions.
- The local healthcare infrastructure is severely lacking, especially for surgical and emergency care.
- The community deeply values HfA’s contributions and strongly desires their continued presence.
- The situation has led to the lack of emergency care and contributed to a growing measles outbreak.

### Convergent Norms:
- The safety and well-being of HfA's staff are paramount.
- Acknowledgment of the essential role of healthcare services provided by HfA in the community.
- The importance of respecting and compensating guards and their families who have supported HfA’s operations.
- The need for urgent action to address the measles outbreak and continued medical services for the local population.

### Divergent Norms:
- HfA’s strategic priority and resource allocation vs. the immediate and future healthcare needs of the Iguwafe community.
- The method of negotiating HfA's continued presence or transition of services in Iguwafe.
- The extent to which local tribal leaders and authorities should influence or control HfA's operations and decisions.
- The balance between HfA's policy against ransom payments and finding a peaceful resolution to ensure staff safety.

### Recommendations

#### Prioritize:
- Engaging with tribal leaders and local authorities in a respectful and open manner to find a mutually acceptable solution.
- Safety of HfA's staff, including ensuring they have safe passage to continue their work or be repatriated.
- Negotiating a clear and realistic transition plan that either extends HfA's presence or ensures a handover to capable local or government healthcare providers.
- Finding immediate solutions to pressing health crises, such as the measles outbreak, possibly through temporary agreements or partnerships with other NGOs or UN agencies.
- Addressing the compensation and support for the guards’ families as a gesture of goodwill and recognition of their sacrifices.

#### Avoid:
- Escalating tensions with actions perceived as disrespectful or undermining the authority of tribal leaders or local norms.
- Making promises that HfA cannot keep, leading to further loss of trust within the community.
- Completely pulling out without establishing a viable transition plan for healthcare services in Iguwafe.
- Ignoring local dynamics and the importance of local guards and their families in the negotiation process.
- Closing communication channels with any stakeholders, including the government, tribal leaders, local hospital staff, and the guards' families.
