### Recommendations:

- Seeking temporary agreements to ensure the immediate continuation of essential health services while a long-term solution is negotiated.
- Leveraging support from international bodies, like the UN and local NGOs such as Food Without Borders, for negotiation support and to explore potential partnerships for healthcare continuation.
- Clarifying the compensation for the guards’ families as a humanitarian gesture, distinct from any perceived obligations or ransom.

#### Avoid:
- Any actions or statements that could be perceived as disrespectful to local norms, including unauthorized attempts to contact detained staff.
- Further unilateral decision-making without consulting local stakeholders.
- Public confrontations or communication that could escalate tensions.
- Ignoring the critical import of local guards and their families’ grievances.
- Treating the situation solely as a financial or logistical issue, overlooking cultural, emotional, and societal impacts.
