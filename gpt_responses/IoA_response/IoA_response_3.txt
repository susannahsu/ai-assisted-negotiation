Based on the provided information regarding the negotiation between Food Without Borders (FWB) and the camp authorities in Country Alpha, the following is the Island of Agreement (IoA) table structured categorically:

**Contested Facts:**
- The necessity and methodology of the nutritional assessment required by FWB.
- The capability and integrity of camp guards in managing food distribution without engaging in exploitation or diversion of food rations.
- The assertion by camp authorities that guards' families are also facing food insecurity and the consequent suggestion that they be compensated with food rations.
- The sufficiency and reliability of existing data on the refugees' nutritional status as claimed by the Camp Commander.

**Agreed Facts:**
- Over 160,000 displaced individuals are in dire need of food assistance within the primary refugee camp.
- Continuous influx of new arrivals, with a considerable number being children and women facing severe nutritional deficiencies.
- Local guards are pivotal to the camp's daily operations and are currently engaged in the food distribution process as proposed by the camp authorities.
- Food rations are increasingly seen as a vital form of compensation due to the local market conditions.

**Convergent Norms:**
- Both parties recognize the urgent need for relief and food assistance to reach the refugees effectively.
- Recognition of the importance of security within the camp, although perspectives differ on the execution and personnel involved.
- Acknowledgment of some level of food insecurity among the guards' families, suggesting an ethical consideration for their welfare.
- A shared goal to maintain order and prevent the camp's situation from affecting the local community negatively.

**Divergent Norms:**
- FWB's principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence versus the camp authorities' insistence on employing guards for security and distribution roles.
- The validity and ethical considerations of compensating guards (and potentially their families) with food rations, which might be diverted from refugees in need.
- FWB's preference for conducting a comprehensive nutritional assessment to guide its food distribution versus the camp commander's request for immediate food aid distribution.

**Recommendations:**

*Prioritize:*
- Finding common ground on the use of neutral, vetted daily laborers for food distribution that satisfies both FWB's independence and the camp authorities' security concerns.
- Suggesting a joint oversight mechanism to ensure transparency and accountability in food distribution, potentially including third-party observers like representatives from the UN or neutral local NGOs.
- Proposing alternative models of compensation for guards that do not directly involve food rations intended for refugees, such as sourcing separate funding for guard compensation.
- Implementing stringent monitoring and reporting systems to track food distribution and prevent diversion, providing assurances to FWB and the camp authorities.

*Avoid:*
- Offering immediate concessions that contradict FWB's core principles, particularly in hiring practices and compensations that could exacerbate diversion risks.
- Dismissing the authorities' security concerns and proceeding without their consent, which could jeopardize the safety of FWB staff and the distribution process.
- Ignoring local norms and economic realities that might affect the feasibility of certain compensation models, including the preference for food rations over cash.
- Overlooking the voices and concerns of the refugees themselves, ensuring that any agreement respects their dignity and rights amidst the negotiation process.
