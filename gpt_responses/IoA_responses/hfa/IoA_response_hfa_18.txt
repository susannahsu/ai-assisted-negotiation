### Island of Agreement (IoA) Table

#### Contested Facts:

- The inevitability of HfA’s withdrawal from Beta.
- The characterization of HfA’s departure as "humanitarian colonialism."
- The local perception of HfA's decision-making process and consultation with local communities.
- The impacts of HfA's departure on local healthcare, including the measles outbreak and surgical needs.

#### Agreed Facts:

- The need for safety and security of humanitarian staff.
- Recognition of local guards' sacrifices and the need for support for their families.
- Acknowledgment that continuous dialogue and negotiation are crucial for resolving the current crisis.

#### Divergent Norms:
- HfA prioritizes redeployment to areas like Ukraine due to donor pressures, while local stakeholders wish for HfA to continue its operations in Iguwafe.
- Different views on HfA’s responsibilities towards the local guards' families and affected communities.
- Disagreements on the approach towards handling the measles outbreak and other healthcare needs in the absence of HfA.

### Recommendations

#### Prioritize:
- Open and transparent communication with all stakeholders, particularly tribal leaders and local healthcare representatives, to clarify intentions and plans.
- Exploration of compromises that could allow HfA to fulfill its imminent obligations in Ukraine while still supporting local healthcare needs, possibly through phased withdrawal or partnership with other NGOs.
- Formulating a concrete plan for transitioning healthcare services to local authorities or other NGOs, ensuring it includes support for the immediate healthcare crises, like the measles outbreak.
- Addressing the safety and compensation concerns of the local guards and their families as a priority, which could facilitate goodwill and cooperation from the tribal leaders.

#### Avoid:
- Unilateral decisions or actions that may exacerbate tensions or misunderstandings with local communities and stakeholders.
- Downplaying the importance of local norms, expectations, and understanding of the situation, thereby alienating potential allies in the negotiation.
- Ignoring the broader impacts of HfA’s departure on the local healthcare system, which could harm HfA’s reputation and operational capacity in similar contexts globally.
- Dismissing the opportunities for collaborative solutions with local leaders, other NGOs, and the government, which could mitigate the negative consequences of HfA’s withdrawal.
