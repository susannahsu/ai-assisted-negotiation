Based on the provided information, the Island of Agreement (IoA) table is populated as follows:

**Contested Facts:**
- The necessity of employing local guards for the distribution process.
- Accuracy and sufficiency of the camp authorities' data on the refugees' nutritional status.
- The appropriateness and feasibility of a comprehensive nutritional assessment by FWB before food distribution.
- The efficacy and ethics of compensating guards and their families with food rations.
- The possibility of aid diversion by local militia through the employment of guards.
- The characterization of refugees from Omega as terrorists by Alpha authorities.
- The extent of food insecurity among the local village and guard families.

**Agreed Facts:**
- Over 160,000 refugees are housed in the primary camp, with a significant portion in dire need of food assistance.
- The presence of FWB is accepted by the camp authorities for the purpose of distributing food rations.
- Many refugees are facing severe nutritional deficiencies, inadequate shelter, and lack access to clean water.
- The German government requires a nutritional assessment to ensure aid reaches those in need.
- The local economy and the guards’ families depend significantly on employment within the camp and compensation in the form of food rations.

**Convergent Norms:**
- Acknowledgment from all parties of the urgent need for food assistance to alleviate the plight of the refugees.
- Recognition of the challenging living conditions and the need for humanitarian aid to ensure the refugees' survival and dignity.
- A general understanding of the importance of a clear and effective distribution plan for food rations.

**Divergent Norms:**
- FWB's principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence versus the camp authorities’ demand to employ local guards for distribution.
- FWB's policy against in-kind food payments versus the camp authorities and local guards' insistence on food rations as compensation.
- The different views on the legal status and treatment of refugees from Omega within Alpha.

**Recommendations**

**Prioritize:**
- Establishing a mutually acceptable method for ensuring the security and efficiency of food distribution without compromising FWB's principles. This may involve international or neutral oversight.
- Advocating for an independent nutritional assessment to optimize aid effectiveness, possibly with support from neutral entities like the United Nations.
- Developing a compensation mechanism for local labor that respects FWB’s policies and addresses the economic realities on the ground, perhaps through third-party managed vouchers redeemable for food or goods, not directly provided by FWB.
- Building a coalition with other NGOs, international agencies, and potentially sympathetic elements within the Alpha government to support a more humane and effective management of the camp.
- Engaging in dialogue with the camp authorities to explore the employment of non-militia members from the local community for food distribution tasks, possibly offering training or other benefits as incentives.

**Avoid:**
- Direct confrontation or actions that could escalate tensions or result in FWB being expelled from the camp, thereby endangering the food aid operation.
- Accepting conditions that would compromise FWB's neutrality, such as hiring local guards directly involved with armed militia or distributing food rations as compensation, which contradicts donor policies and could facilitate aid diversion.
- Ignoring the broader geopolitical and security dynamics between Alpha and Omega, which shape the operational environment and affect negotiation strategies.
- Overlooking the potential for leveraging international diplomatic pressure or media attention to influence the camp authorities' stance, albeit with caution given the sensitivities and possible repercussions.
