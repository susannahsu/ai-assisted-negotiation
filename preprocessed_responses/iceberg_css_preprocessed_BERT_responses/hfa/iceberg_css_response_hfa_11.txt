given the complex and multifaceted situation involving health for all (hfa) and the tribesmen in iguwafe, the negotiation requires a nuanced approach, addressing several critical issues. these issues include the demand by the tribesmen for hfa to continue its medical operations and provide additional benefits, the broader context of hfa's global resource reallocation to ukraine under donor pressure, and the local community's urgent healthcare needs. below is a structured analysis based on these aspects:

 aspect [NUMBER]: continuation of medical services by hfa

 counterparty (tribesmen and local community):
- positions: demand for hfa to continue its surgical and healthcare services in iguwafe.
- reasoning: the abrupt decision to leave exacerbates the already dire healthcare situation in the region.
- motives and values: preservation of community well-being and addressing the immediate healthcare needs, including rising measles cases.

 user’s organization (hfa):
- motives and values: committed to providing healthcare where most needed but constrained by donor directives and resource allocation challenges.
- reasoning: shift focus to ukraine due to escalating conflict and donor pressure, despite recognizing ongoing needs in iguwafe.
- positions: planned withdrawal from iguwafe, intending to redirect resources to ukraine.

 aspect [NUMBER]: benefits and compensation for local guards

 counterparty:
- positions: require benefits for the hospital's guards, some of whom have died or suffered disabilities.
- reasoning: the guards played a critical role at great personal risk during the period of hfa's operations.
- motives and values: justice and compensation for the families affected by loss and injury, ensuring they are not left destitute due to hfa's departure.

 user’s organization (hfa):
- motives and values: recognition of the guards' sacrifices and the need for ethical responsibility towards them.
- reasoning: balancing the organization's operational priorities with its ethical obligations to local partners.
- positions: negotiating a solution that acknowledges the guards' contribution without setting unsustainable precedents.

 aspect [NUMBER]: addressing immediate health crises (e.g., measles outbreak)

 counterparty:
- positions: urgent need for hfa's intervention in controlling the measles outbreak and other public health crises.
- reasoning: hfa possesses the expertise and resources necessary for effective outbreak response.
- motives and values: protecting the health and well-being of the community, especially vulnerable populations like children.

 user’s organization (hfa):
- motives and values: commitment to alleviating human suffering and preventing disease outbreaks.
- reasoning: needs to balance immediate health crisis intervention with long-term operational sustainability and donor expectations.
- positions: willingness to engage in short-term measures to assist in outbreak control while seeking alternative solutions for long-term sustainability.

---

in moving forward, both parties need to engage in dialogue focused on understanding each other's constraints and identifying areas of mutual interest. for hfa, emphasizing compassionate withdrawal strategies, including phased transitions and support for local capacity-building, might alleviate some of the immediate tensions. on the other hand, opening channels for local stakeholders' involvement in planning and decision-making may help address some of the underlying issues of trust and representation.
