This Python script represents a stakeholder map for the case concerning Food Without Borders (FWB) assisting refugees in Alpha. The map visualizes the relationships and positions of various stakeholders, including the camp authorities (counter party), FWB (user party), along with other entities like the UN Humanitarian Coordinator, Health for All, and the German Government, among others. The placement of each stakeholder has been determined based on their inclination towards change (transformative to conservative) and their influence (local to global). Remember, you can adjust the coordinates and labels of stakeholders based on further analysis or evolving negotiation dynamics.
