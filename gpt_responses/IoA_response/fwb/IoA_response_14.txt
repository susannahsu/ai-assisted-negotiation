**Island of Agreement (IoA) table:**

- **Contested Facts:**
  1. Camp authorities insist that the current data on refugees' nutritional status is sufficient, while FWB wants to conduct its own nutritional assessment.
  2. Camp authorities demand local guards to be hired and compensated with food rations for food distribution, contrary to FWB's policy and principle.
  3. The effectiveness and necessity of employing local guards for security and distribution tasks are disputed between FWB and the camp authorities.

- **Agreed Facts:**
  1. Over 160,000 forcibly displaced refugees are living in critical conditions with severe nutritional deficiencies, inadequate shelter, and limited access to healthcare.
  2. Food assistance is urgently needed for the refugee population to save lives and restore human dignity.
  3. Both parties recognize the importance of a clear distribution plan for the food rations.

- **Convergent Norms:**
  1. The welfare and well-being of the refugee population, especially children and women, is a common concern.
  2. Both parties acknowledge the necessity of urgent food aid distribution to alleviate the humanitarian crisis.
  3. Recognition of the need for security and orderly distribution within the camp to prevent exploitation and ensure aid reaches its intended beneficiaries.

- **Divergent Norms:**
  1. FWB adheres to principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which conflict with the camp authorities' demand for hiring local guards associated with militias.
  2. Different views on compensating guards with food rations due to the risk of diverting aid from its intended beneficiaries.
  3. The legal and ethical obligations toward the refugees differ significantly, with FWB focusing on humanitarian aid and camp authorities emphasizing control and confinement.

**Recommendations:**

- **Prioritize:**
  1. Exploring third-party mediation to facilitate dialogue and negotiate terms acceptable to both parties.
  2. Developing a transparent and mutually agreed-upon mechanism for aid distribution that allows for oversight without directly involving militia members.
  3. Establishing a joint monitoring and evaluation framework that includes regular assessments of the nutritional and health status of the refugee population.
  4. Seeking support from international bodies or donor countries to influence and persuade the camp authorities to align with international humanitarian norms.
  5. Implementing community-based initiatives that leverage refugee leaders and reputable local civilians to participate in the distribution process.

- **Avoid:**
  1. Compromising on FWB's core principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which could endanger its operations in other regions.
  2. Agreeing to demands that directly conflict with humanitarian and ethical standards, such as compensating militia members with food rations.
  3. Ignoring the input and grievances of the refugee population, which could erode trust and further marginalize the most vulnerable.
  4. Overlooking international legal frameworks and standards that apply to the treatment and care of refugees.
  5. Allowing the negotiation process to stall, risking the exacerbation of the already dire humanitarian crisis.
