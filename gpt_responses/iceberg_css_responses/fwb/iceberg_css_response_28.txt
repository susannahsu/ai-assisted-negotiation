### Negotiation Strategy: Food Without Borders (FWB) and Camp Authorities

#### Aspect 1: Involvement of Local Guards in Food Distribution

- **Counterparty (Camp Authorities) Position, Reasoning, and Motives:**
    - **Positions (What):** Insists on FWB employing local guards for food distribution.
    - **Reasoning (How):** Argues guards perform duties beyond security, warranting compensation akin to day laborers.
    - **Motives and Values (Why):** Seeks to maintain control within the camp, ensuring guards (and by extension their families) receive food as compensation, addressing food insecurity while sustaining their power structure.

- **User’s Organization (FWB) Motives, Reasoning, and Positions:**
    - **Motives and Values (Why):** Ensuring neutrality, impartiality, and preventing the diversion of aid.
    - **Reasoning (How):** Utilizes a principled stance against empowering potentially coercive local forces, to prevent compromising FWB's operational integrity and aid effectiveness.
    - **Positions (What):** Opposes hiring guards involved with local militia, advocates for the right to independently vet and hire daily laborers outside the militias.

#### Aspect 2: Compensation for Local Guards

- **Counterparty (Camp Authorities) Position, Reasoning, and Motives:**
    - **Positions (What):** Demands food rations as compensation for the services of local guards.
    - **Reasoning (How):** Justifies this by highlighting the utility of food rations in the local economy over cash, due to high market prices and scarcity of goods.
    - **Motives and Values (Why):** Aims to alleviate guard's food insecurity, while also potentially diverting resources for personal or militia gain.

- **User’s Organization (FWB) Motives, Reasoning, and Positions:**
    - **Motives and Values (Why):** Committed to direct and efficient aid delivery to refugees, ensuring aid is not diverted.
    - **Reasoning (How):** Believes cash compensation maintains integrity and allows for traceability of resources, avoiding propelling an illicit market.
    - **Positions (What):** Rejects food rations as compensation, preferring cash payments to safeguard aid from being hijacked.

#### Aspect 3: Nutritional Assessment and Aid Distribution Plan

- **Counterparty (Camp Authorities) Position, Reasoning, and Motives:**
    - **Positions (What):** Prefers immediate food distribution without new assessments.
    - **Reasoning (How):** Claims existing data is sufficient; emphasizes urgent relief to alleviate pressure on families.
    - **Motives and Values (Why):** Prioritizes rapid assistance, potentially to diminish internal camp strains or to avoid transparent assessments which may reveal diversion of aid.

- **User’s Organization (FWB) Motives, Reasoning, and Positions:**
    - **Motives and Values (Why):** Executes a committed approach to identify and assist those in genuine need, abiding by donor requirements for informed aid delivery.
    - **Reasoning (How):** Advocates for up-to-date, data-driven assessments to ensure correct targeting and meet donor obligations.
    - **Positions (What):** Demands completion of a new nutritional assessment before launching the food distribution to accurately address and prioritize needs.
