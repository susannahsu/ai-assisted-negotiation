based on the detailed information provided regarding the negotiation environment between fwb and camp authorities in country alpha, the island of agreement (ioa) table can be populated as follows:

contested facts
- the necessity and logistics of conducting a new technical nutritional assessment within the camp.
- the appropriateness and method of compensating local guards for assisting in food ration distribution.
- the reliability and current relevance of the camp figures and nutritional data provided by the camp authorities.
- the effectiveness of employing local guards in the distribution process without affecting the neutrality and impartiality of fwb.

agreed facts
- the urgent need for food assistance among the refugee population, exacerbated by continuous influxes of new arrivals from omega.
- the overall dire sanitary, hygiene, and nutritional conditions within the camp, acknowledging that many residents face severe food insecurity.
- the camp's strategic location and its significant population size, housing over [NUMBER],[NUMBER] displaced individuals.
- the acknowledgment from both parties (fwb and camp authorities) about the presence of local guards with links to armed militias.

convergent norms
- the shared objective of providing emergency food aid to the refugee population as swiftly and effectively as possible.
- the recognition of security concerns within the camp, mentioned by both fwb and the camp authorities, albeit with different proposed methods of addressing them.
- the importance of ensuring the intended beneficiaries (refugees) receive the food aid, as highlighted by the concerns of aid diversion.

divergent norms
- fwb’s commitment to neutrality, impartiality, and independence in its operations versus the camp authority’s demand for employing local guards for food distribution.
- the method of compensating laborers (with fwb preferring cash to avoid diversion of food, and the camp authorities insisting on food rations).
- the right of fwb to conduct its own assessment and operations within the camp versus the camp authority’s restrictions on fwb’s operational autonomy.

recommendations for the negotiation

prioritize:
- advocating for the employment of non-guard daily laborers vetted by fwb to maintain neutrality and minimize aid diversion. engage in discussions about possible infrastructure or systems (e.g., digital tracking, community oversight committees) that could allow for secure food distribution without requiring guard involvement.
- establishing a mutually agreed method for a quick assessment that satisfies both the need for updated nutritional data and the urgency of commencing food distribution.
- emphasizing shared convergent norms, particularly the shared goal of efficiently and fairly distributing food aid, as a foundation for building trust and cooperation with the camp authorities.
- seeking third-party mediation or assistance (from the un, for instance) to provide oversight and an additional layer of impartiality and security for the food distribution process.

avoid:
- agreeing to any arrangements that directly involve the local militia or compromise fwb's principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.
- dismissing the camp authorities’ concerns regarding security and their insistence on local guard involvement without proposing viable, alternative security arrangements.
- undermining the urgency and critical nature of the situation by insisting on processes that could excessively delay the initiation of food distribution.
- engaging in actions that could be perceived as bypassing or directly challenging the camp authorities without first attempting collaborative resolutions.
