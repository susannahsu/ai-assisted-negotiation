To guide the Health for All (HfA) team through stakeholder mapping in their negotiation to resolve the crisis in Iguwafe, following is the breakdown:

### 1. Protagonist: Health for All (HfA)
- **Role**: International health organization providing critical surgical care in conflict and post-conflict zones.

### Counterparty: Tribal Leaders (at the center, marked in red)
- **Role**: Local authority with significant influence over community and security matters, currently opposing HfA's sudden operational changes.

### Other Key Stakeholders:

1. **Local Government of Country Beta**
   - **Role**: National authority with a vested interest in maintaining healthcare services in rural areas but limited involvement in the resolution of the current crisis.
   
2. **Tribal Guards and Their Families**
   - **Role**: Local security personnel and their dependents, significantly impacted by HfA's potential withdrawal and demanding compensation.
   
3. **Local Hospital Staff and Patient Association**
   - **Role**: Directly affected by HfA's operational status, advocating for the continuation of medical services and highlighting urgent healthcare needs such as measles outbreaks.
   
4. **German and Swiss Donors**
   - **Role**: Main financial backers pressuring HfA to relocate resources to Ukraine, influencing strategic decisions.
   
5. **UN Representatives in Beta**
   - **Role**: Global body concerned with maintaining peace and security; advising on negotiation strategies without directly intervening.
   
6. **Food Without Borders (FWB)**
   - **Role**: Another humanitarian organization in Beta, offering support but highlighting the constraints of donor preferences.
   
7. **International Media and Local Press**
   - **Role**: Influencing public opinion and potentially swaying stakeholder positions through coverage of the crisis.

8. **Child Protection International (CPI)**
   - **Role**: Advocating for continued medical assistance, especially for child victims requiring reconstructive surgery.

9. **Head Surgeon of HfA in Iguwafe**
   - **Role**: Represents the detained HfA staffâ€™s interests and their willingness to either leave or continue serving, depending on the negotiation's outcome.

Given this information, the stakeholder map will plot these parties based on their inclination towards change (e.g., desire for HfA to remain or pivot to Ukraine) and their influence level (from local to global impact).

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map: HfA Negotiation in Iguwafe')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party (Tribal Leaders)
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Tribal Leaders')  # 'ro' for red circle

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Plotting other parties
# Positions are hypothetical and should be adjusted based on the analysis
parties = {
    'Local Government': (-5, 5),
    'Tribal Guards/Families': (-3, 3),
    'Hospital Staff/Patient Assoc.': (-4, 4),
    'German/Swiss Donors': (7, 7),
    'UN Representatives': (2, 8),
    'FWB': (-3, 2),
    'Media': (-2, 6),
    'CPI': (-5, 6),
    'Head Surgeon & Staff': (-1, 1),
    'HfA': (6, -2) # Assuming HfA's position as transforming towards Ukraine
}

# Adding labels and dots for each party
for party, coords in parties.items():
    x, y = coords
    ax.plot(x, y, 'bo')  # 'bo' for blue circle
    ax.annotate(party, (x, y), textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Show the plot
plt.xticks(np.arange(-10, 10, 1))
plt.yticks(np.arange(-10, 10, 1))
plt.show()
```
This Python script initializes a stakeholder map placing the Tribal Leaders at the center as the counterparty, with Health for All and other key stakeholders plotted based on their objectives and influence. Keep in mind, the exact coordinates here are placeholders and should be refined through further stakeholder analysis.
