based on the detailed situation involving health for all (hfa) and the stakeholders in iguwafe, here is the island of agreement (ioa) analysis:

 contested facts:
- hfa's sudden decision and poor communication regarding the cessation of its operations in beta.
- the tribal leaders' contention that hfa has obligations towards the local guards' families.
- the misunderstanding regarding the status of detained hfa staff (hostage situation vs. labor dispute).

 agreed facts:
- hfa has been instrumental in providing surgical care and addressing the healthcare needs in iguwafe amidst security challenges.
- the local healthcare infrastructure is heavily impacted by protracted violence and lacks capabilities to meet the population's needs without ngos' support.
- rising measles cases in the region are concerning, and immediate healthcare interventions are required.
- the local tribal leadership and community deeply value hfa's contribution to healthcare in the district.

 convergent norms:
- the safety and well-being of the detained hfa staff are of paramount importance to all parties.
- healthcare access is recognized as a critical need for the population of iguwafe by both hfa and the tribal leaders.
- all parties demonstrate a commitment to dialogue as a means to resolve the current crisis.

 divergent norms:
- hfa's policy of reallocating resources to other conflict zones, given the evolving needs in iguwafe versus the local expectation for continued support.
- compensation for local guards and their families seen as hfa's responsibility versus hfa's view of its mission limits.
- the local tribal leaders' involvement in healthcare service continuation versus hfa's operational decisions driven by donor demands and global priorities.

 recommendations:

 prioritize:
- direct negotiations with tribal leaders to ensure the safe release of hfa staff with clear commitments on non-ransom.
- developing an interim operational plan that provides measles vaccination and essential surgical services while seeking a sustainable transition to local or other ngo operation.
- establishing a clear communication strategy to manage expectations about hfaâ€™s future involvement in iguwafe.
- identifying potential partnership with organizations like swisscross for specialized services like plastic surgery for children.
- setting up a task force to explore compensation for the families of the deceased guards, possibly in collaboration with other ngos or international bodies.

 avoid:
- publicly challenging the tribal leaders or disputing their authority in the process; this will only escalate tensions.
- making commitments that hfa cannot realistically honor due to the constraints imposed by their funding conditions and mission focus.
- delaying the negotiation with the tribal leaders and other local stakeholders, as this may further endanger the safety of the staff and the health of the population needing medical care.
- ignoring the broad spectrum of healthcare needs in the district, including non-surgical ones like infectious disease outbreaks.

following these guidelines will help hfa navigate the complex negotiation landscape in iguwafe, balance competing demands, and hopefully lead to a resolution that safeguards both its staff and the ongoing healthcare needs of the local population.
