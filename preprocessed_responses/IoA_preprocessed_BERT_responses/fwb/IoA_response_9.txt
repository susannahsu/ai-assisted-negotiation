 island of agreement (ioa) table:

 contested facts:
- the necessity and methodology for conducting a nutritional assessment of the refugee population.
- the role and compensation of local guards in the food distribution process.
- the sufficiency of existing data on the population's nutritional status as claimed by the camp commander.
- the assertion by militia leaders that local guards deserve food aid as much or more than the refugees.
- the perception of refugees as potential terrorists by the government of alpha.

 agreed facts:
- over [NUMBER],[NUMBER] forcibly displaced refugees are located in the primary camp near the national hero roundabout, facing severe nutritional deficiencies and inadequate living conditions.
- continuous influx of new arrivals, primarily consisting of women and children.
- existence of security concerns within the camp, including extortion and violence by camp guards.
- fwb's offering of emergency food rations to refugee families has been accepted by the camp authorities.
- local guards and militias exert significant control over the camp's population.

 convergent norms:
- the urgent need for relief assistance to reach refugees to alleviate food shortages and nutritional deficiencies.
- recognition by various parties of the fundamental objective to provide emergency aid to the refugee population.
- a general understanding of the local economy's reliance on the camp for job opportunities.

 divergent norms:
- fwb's principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence versus camp authorities' demands for fwb to employ local guards for food distribution.
- the local camp authorities' and militia's view on compensating guards with food rations versus fwb's policy against in-kind food payments to prevent diversion.
- the method of conducting assessments and determining the beneficiaries of the food aid.
- the view of the alpha government and militia leaders on the status and treatment of refugees versus international humanitarian norms advocated by fwb and other ngos.

 recommendations:

 prioritize:
- finding a negotiation pathway that allows fwb to conduct its nutritional assessment to ensure food aid is directed to those in dire need without undue delay.
- exploring alternative, verifiable measures for ensuring security during food distribution that does not undermine fwbâ€™s principles.
- engaging with third-party actors, such as the un, local ngos like health for all, and possibly the international community, to provide a broader support framework and oversight mechanism. 
- developing a transparent, accountable system for food distribution that includes supervision by non-militia personnel, potentially through mobile technologies or third-party monitoring.
- advocating for the inclusion of external observers during food distribution to ensure transparency and reduce the risk of diversion.

 avoid:
- directly hiring guards associated with the local militia to maintain fwb's neutrality, independence, and compliance with its donors' regulations.
- immediate compliance with the camp authorities' request for in-kind compensation to guards without exploring all possible alternatives to prevent potential diversion of aid.
- engaging in actions that could be perceived as supporting one party in the conflict, especially in the view of the camp's residents and the international community.
- delaying the provision of emergency food aid by becoming mired in prolonged negotiations without seeking interim solutions.
- overlooking the abuses and violations reported by refugees, local ngos, and other observers in efforts to appease the camp authorities and local militia.
  
the focus should remain steadfast on delivering humanitarian aid effectively while upholding the principles of neutrality and impartiality. it's crucial to negotiate terms that safeguard fwb's mission and ensure that the aid reaches its intended beneficiaries without enabling or exacerbating existing conflicts and power dynamics within the camp.
