#### Counterparty (Camp Authorities)
- **Positions (What):** Demand that FWB hires local guards to assist in food ration distribution.
- **Reasoning (How):** Believe guards' duties go beyond security, aiding in distribution management and should be compensated equivalently to day laborers.
- **Motives and Values (Why):** To provide food security for guards' families; maintaining control and authority within the camp; ensuring the local militia, including guards, remains operational and rewarded for their service.

#### User’s Organization (FWB)
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Upholding principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence; ensuring food aid reaches refugees without diversion or exploitation.
- **Reasoning (How):** Hiring local guards, members of the militia, conflicts with FWB’s neutrality and might lead to aid diversion.
- **Positions (What):** Opposes hiring local guards for food distribution; seeks to employ daily laborers from the local community surrounding the camp, subject to FWB’s vetting.

#### Counterparty (Camp Authorities)
- **Positions (What):** Seek food rations as compensation for guards’ families, arguing it's the most practical form of remuneration in the current economy.
- **Reasoning (How):** Cash has limited utility locally; food rations are more valuable and necessary for sustenance.
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Addressing the food insecurity of guards’ families; leveraging food aid distribution to ensure guards are compensated in a valuable manner; supporting the local militia infrastructure through in-kind contributions.

#### User’s Organization (FWB)
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Preventing diversion of food aid from its intended beneficiaries; ensuring food assistance reaches those most in need.

- **Reasoning (How):** Citing security concerns and the need for camp order as justifications for strict oversight.

#### User’s Organization (FWB)
- **Motives and Values (Why):** Ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of aid distribution based on human rights and dignity; adhering to the organization’s core principles.
- **Reasoning (How):** FWB's independence in operations is essential for unbiased and equitable aid distribution, securing the trust of refugees and donors.
