**Island of Agreement Table:**

**Contested Facts:**
- Effectiveness of the camp's current data on the population's nutritional status.
- Necessity and scope of FWB's proposed nutritional assessment.
- The true intentions and activities of refugees trading food rations.
- The impact of employing local guards on the neutrality and impartiality of FWB.

**Agreed Facts:**
- Over 160,000 refugees are housed in the primary camp, with children and women comprising a majority and facing severe nutritional deficiencies.
- Refugees are confined to the camps and require permission to leave, exposing them to control and exploitation by local guards.
- FWB has committed to providing emergency food aid to the refugees.
- All parties acknowledge the critical need for food aid among the refugee population.

**Convergent Norms:**
- The immediate and uninterrupted provision of food aid is crucial for the well-being and survival of the refugees.
- Maintaining the dignity, safety, and health of the refugee population is a priority.
- Efforts should be made to ensure aid reaches its intended beneficiaries without diversion.

**Divergent Norms:**
- FWB insists on neutrality, impartiality, and independence in its operations, refraining from employing local militia members as guards.
- Camp authorities demand local guards be compensated with food rations for their services, citing their families' food insecurity.
- The camp authorities and local militia view the employment and compensation of guards differently than FWB, considering them and their families as deserving beneficiaries.

**Recommendations:**

**Prioritize:**
- Engaging an independent third party to conduct the nutritional assessment to ensure transparency and acceptance by all parties.
- Exploring alternative mechanisms for distributing food aid that maintain FWB’s principles while addressing security concerns, possibly through technology or third-party monitoring.
- Working with international and local stakeholders to establish a monitored corridor or safe zones that allow FWB to operate independently within the camp.
- Advocating for additional resources and support from the international community to address the broader humanitarian needs, beyond food, like health, sanitation, and potential relocation or resettlement pathways for refugees.

**Avoid:**
- Direct employment or compensation of local militia members as it violates FWB's principles and risks further entrenching power dynamics that exploit refugees.
- Overlooking the importance of a comprehensive and transparent assessment of the refugees' nutritional needs, as it could lead to inefficient aid distribution.
- Underestimating the potential leverage and influence that international and governmental stakeholders might exert over the camp authorities and local militia.
- Ignoring the long-term implications of decisions made regarding employment and compensation structures within the camp on the community and FWB’s operational integrity.
