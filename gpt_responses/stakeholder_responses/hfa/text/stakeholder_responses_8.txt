Given the complex situation involving Health for All (HfA) in the rural district of Iguwafe, Country Beta, we will visualize the stakeholder dynamics to better understand the multifaceted negotiation context. Based on the extensive provided details, we'll map the stakeholders according to their influence and inclination towards change in the healthcare provision context in Iguwafe.

Key stakeholders include:
- **HfA (protagonist)**: Aims to negotiate the safe release of its staff and reroute its resources to Ukraine due to donor pressure.
- **Local Tribesmen (counterparty)**: Oppose HfA's departure and have detained HfA staff to punctuate their demand for continued healthcare services.
- **Tribal Leaders**: Mediate between HfA and the local population, insisting on a continuation of healthcare services and compensation for local guards.
- **Local Government and Police**: Maintain a distant and neutral stance, viewing the conflict as a labor dispute while expressing concerns about escalating violence.
- **International Donors (Germany and Switzerland)**: Exert pressure on HfA to relocate resources to Ukraine, emphasizing conflict zone needs.
- **Patients and Local Hospital Staff**: Demand the continuation of healthcare services, emphasizing HfA's role in the local healthcare ecosystem.
- **Food Without Borders (FWB)**: Express solidarity with HfA, facing similar financial pressures but emphasizing the need for compromise with tribal leaders.
- **UN Representatives**: Highlight the importance of continued dialogue with tribal leaders for the safe release of HfA staff, with cautious advice on handling ransom demands.
- **Child Protection International (CPI)**: Advocates for the continuation of specialized healthcare services, especially for children requiring reconstructive surgery.

The stakeholder map will display these parties based on their inclination towards transformative (implementing change) vs. conservative (maintaining status quo) actions regarding healthcare provision in Iguwafe, and their local vs. global influence.

Here is the standardized Python `matplotlib` script to visualize these dynamics:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Initialize the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Stakeholder Map')
ax.set_xlabel('Objective of Negotiation (Transformative to Conservative)')
ax.set_ylabel('Identity of Stakeholders (Local to Global Influence)')

# Plot the counter party
ax.plot(0, 0, 'ro', label='Local Tribesmen')  # 'ro' for red circle, identified as the counterparty

# Adjust the axes
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.axhline(0, color='black')  # Add horizontal axis line
ax.axvline(0, color='black')  # Add vertical axis line

# Example of plotting other parties with their coordinates to be determined based on the context
# The coordinates will be refined based on detailed analysis and feedback
parties = {
    'HfA': (2, 8),
    'Tribal Leaders': (-2, 5),
    'Local Government and Police': (0, 3),
    'Germany and Switzerland': (5, 9),
    'Patients and Local Staff': (-3, 4),
    'Food Without Borders (FWB)': (-1, 7),
    'UN Representatives': (1, 6),
    'Child Protection International': (-4, 7)
}

# Plotting other stakeholders
for party, coords in parties.items():
    ax.plot(*coords, 'bo')  # 'bo' for blue circle
    ax.annotate(party, coords, textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0,10), ha='center')

# Show the plot
# In an actual implementation, choose to display the plot or save to a file depending on your specific setup
plt.show()
```

This script designs a preliminary stakeholder map, which helps visualize the negotiation landscape HfA faces. For detailed analysis, stakeholders' positions might need adjustments, reflecting their actual inclination and influence based on further insights or evolving circumstances.
