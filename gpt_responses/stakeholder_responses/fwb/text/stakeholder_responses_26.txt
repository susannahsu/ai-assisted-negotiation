This Python script generates a stakeholder map based on your provided information. It positions the key parties involved in the negotiation with FWB's work within the refugee camps. Each party's position on this map was determined by their inclination towards change (x-axis) and their level of influence from local to global (y-axis). The counterparty, in this case, the Camp Authorities, is placed at the origin point (0,0) and marked in red to denote their central role in negotiations. The protagonist, FWB, is plotted with a green dot, indicating their position and perspective relative to the counterparty. Additional stakeholders are included to represent their varied stances and influences in this complex negotiation landscape.

Remember, this visualization serves as a starting point. Stakeholder positions can be adjusted based on further analysis or evolving circumstances within the negotiation context.
