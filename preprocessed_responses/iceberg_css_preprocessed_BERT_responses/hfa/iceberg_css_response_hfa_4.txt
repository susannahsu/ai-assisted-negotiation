 strategy for negotiation:

the negotiation strategy needs to emphasize common ground and shared values—primarily, the health and well-being of the iguwafe community. hfa should clearly communicate its constraints and desire for a responsible transition of services, aiming for solutions that respect the local community's needs and those of hfa's global mission. establishing a clear timeline, engaging local and international stakeholders for support, and framing negotiations around mutual benefits and shared responsibilities will be crucial for a successful outcome.
