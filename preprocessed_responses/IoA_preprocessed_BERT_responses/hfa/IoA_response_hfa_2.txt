  - seeking partnerships or funding for measles vaccination campaigns and special surgical needs as goodwill gestures to demonstrate ongoing commitment to healthcare in iguwafe.

- avoid:

  - engaging in actions that could be perceived as disrespecting local norms and protocols, such as unauthorized attempts to contact detained staff.
  - overcommitting resources or making promises hfa cannot feasibly keep, given the shift of its operations to ukraine.
  - ignoring the potential for enhancing hfa’s reputation and operational effectiveness through constructive dialogue and collaboration with local authorities, ngos, and tribal leaders.
