- establishing a short-term plan for the continuation of critical healthcare services, especially emergency surgeries and measles vaccinations.
- communicating a clear, realistic commitment regarding hfa’s future in iguwafe to avoid misunderstandings.
- collaborating with local stakeholders, including tribal leaders, government officials, and other ngos, for a sustainable healthcare transition strategy.
- offering a concrete support plan for the families of the local guards, possibly through a one-time assistance fund, to acknowledge their sacrifices and importance.

avoid:
- engaging in actions or rhetoric that could be perceived as disrespecting tribal authority or local norms.
- making vague commitments that hfa cannot fulfill, leading to further distrust.
- ignoring the broader social implications of hfa’s departure on the local healthcare infrastructure and community trust.
- underestimating the importance of transparent, inclusive discussions with all relevant stakeholders before making significant decisions.
- disregarding the significance of restoring and maintaining operational healthcare services in the short term as a gesture of good faith and commitment to patient care.
